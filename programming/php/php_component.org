* Component
** Interoperability

PHP community has evolved from a centralized framework model to a distributed ecosystem of efficient, interoperable, and specialized components.

- Interface :: allow frameworks to assume what methods are provided by third-party dependencies
             - without worrying about how the dependencies implement the interface

- Autoloading :: the process by which a class is automatically located and loaded on-demand by the interpreter during runtime
               - before standards, components and frameworks implement their own unique autoloaders using =\__autoload()= or =spl_autoload_register()=
               - modern components and frameworks are compatible with a common autoloader standard

** Sematic Versioning

- 3 numbers separated with a period =.= character

| 1 | major release number | changes that break backward compatibility               |
|---+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| 2 | minor release number | minor features that do not break backward compatibility |
|---+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| 3 | patch release number | backward-compatible bug fixes                           |

* Composer

- dependency manager for PHP components
- runs on the command line
- downloads and autoloads components into project
- simplifies integrating and using third-party PHP components
- works with Packagist

** 安装

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/composer

# ~/.bash_profile, add:
PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
#+END_SRC

** 文件

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
src/
tests/
composer.json
README.md       # Name, description, author, contributor guidelines, software license, etc.
CONTRIBUTING.md # How others can contribute to this component
LICENSE
CHANGELOG.md
#+END_SRC

- =composer.lock= :: lists all PHP components (and version numbers) used by the project
                   - Composer downloads the specific versions listed in =composer.lock= regardless of the latest available versions on Packagist

- =composer.json= :: describes the component
                   - contains information used by Composer to find, install, and autoload the component
                   - contains information for the component's Packagist directory listing
