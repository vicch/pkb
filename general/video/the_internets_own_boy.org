In the 1990s, Berners-Lee was arguably sitting on one of the most lucrative inventions of the 20th century, but instead of profiting from the invention of the World Wide Web, he gave it away for free. It is the only reason the World Wide Web exists today.

He was the internet's own boy, and the old world killed him. We are standing in the middle of a time when great injustice is not touched. Architects of the financial meltdown have dinner with the president, regularly. In the middle of that time, the idea that this is what the government had to prosecute, It just seems absurd, if it weren't tragic.
