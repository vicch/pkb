* 第一章：影响力的武器（Weapons of Influence）

#+begin_quote
当我们请别人帮忙时，如果能够讲出一个理由，那我们得到别人帮助的可能性就更大。原因很简单，人们就是喜欢为自己所做的事找一个理由。

A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason. People simply like to have reasons for what they do.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
现代生活不可避免的一个特质……人类文明进步的一个标志，就是人们可以更频繁地、不假思索地去采取行动。

This inescapable quality of modern life ... civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
一位精通柔道的人在于对手搏斗时，很少会使用他自身的力量。他会尽可能地利用蕴藏在自然原理中的力量，如万有引力、杠杆原理、动量守恒及惯性。

A woman employing jujitsu would utilize her own strength only minimally against an opponent. Instead, she would exploit the power inherent in such naturally present principles as gravity, leverage, momentum, and inertia.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
先将比较贵重的商品展示给顾客可以赚到更多的钱。如果不这样做，对比原理不仅不能发挥其应有的作用，还会适得其反。

It is much more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive item first, not only because to fail to do so will lose the influence of the contrast principle; to fail to do so will also cause the principle to work actively against them.
#+end_quote

* 第二章：互惠（Reciprocation）

#+begin_quote
人类之所以成其为人类，完全要归功于互惠系统。我们能够成为人类，是因为我们的祖先学会了在一个公平的偿还网络中分享他们的食物和技能。这种「偿还网」是人类一种独特的适应机制。正是由于有了这样一张网，才有了劳动的分工，不同商品的交换以及不同服务的交换，使人们得以发展自己在某一方面的技能。

... ascribes the essence of what makes us human to the reciprocity system. We are human because our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation. ... view this "web of indebtedness" as a unique adaptive mechanism of human beings, allowing for the division of labor, the exchange of diverse forms of goods, the exchange of different services (making it possible for experts to develop).
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
「负债感」在人类社会的演变过程中所起的作用是不可低估的。因为这意味着，一个人能够将某种东西给与他人，是因为他相信自己并没失去这个东西。其结果就是：使那些必须向他人提供资源才能开始的交易变得容易起来，使错综复杂而又井然有序的援助、赠与、防御和贸易体系成为可能。

A widely shared and strongly held feeling of future obligation made an enormous difference in human social evolution, because it meant that one person could give something (for example, food, energy, care) to another with confidence that it was not being lost. The result was the lowering of the natural inhibitions against transactions that must be begun by one person's providing personal resources to another. Sophisticated and coordinated systems of aid, gift giving, defense, and trade became possible, bringing immense benefit to the societies that possessed them.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
免费试用的妙处在于，能够利用互惠原理的力量，推销商品的人把礼物本身所固有的让人产生负债感的自然力量释放出来。不要把你从推销人员那里得到的东西当做是礼物，而要把它们看作是一种推销手段。

The beauty of the free sample is that it ... can engage the reciprocity rule. The promoter who gives free samples can release the natural indebting force inherent in a gift. Merely define whatever you have received from the inspector not as gifts, but as sales devices.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
惊讶本身也是一种有效的让人顺从的工具。吃了一惊的人通常都比较可能屈从于当时的环境，因为他们会一下子不知所措，因此更容易受到外界环境的影响。

Surprise is an effective compliance producer in its own right. People who are surprised by a request will often comply because they are momentarily unsure of themselves and, consequently, influenced easily.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
一般来说，人们对不遵守互惠原理的人心存厌恶，所以为了避开这种恶名，即使是不公平的交换，有时候我们也愿意接受。

For the most part, there is a genuine distaste for individuals who fail to conform to the dictates of the reciprocity rule. Moocher and welsher are unsavory labels to be scrupulously shunned. So undesirable are they that we will sometimes agree to an unequal exchange in order to dodge them.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
互惠原理产生的另一个结果是，如果他人对我们做出了让步，我们也有义务作出让步。

Another consequence of the the reciprocity rule is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
「拒绝―退让」策略：一开始提出一个必然被拒绝的要求，然后进行退让，因为我们做出了让步，根据互惠原理的效果，对方也会倾向于作出让步。但如果最初提出的要求太极端无理，这个策略就会产生相反的效果，因为会被对方认为是没有诚意。

Rejection-then-retreat technique : To increase your chances would be first to make a larger request of me, one that I will most likely turn down. Then, after I have refused, you would make the smaller request that you were really interested in all along. Provided that you have structured your requests skillfully, I should view your second request as a concession to me and should feel inclined to respond with a concession of my own. But if the first set of demands is so extreme as to be seen as unreasonable, the tactic backfires. In such cases, the party who has made the extreme first request is not seen to be bargaining in good faith.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
「拒绝―退让」策略的受害者们履行承诺的频率更高，因为请求者的退让行为使他们感觉到是自己促成了协议的达成。一个觉得自己对合同条款富有相当责任的人，履行该合同的可能性更高。

... why the rejection-then-retreat technique causes its targets to live up to their agreements with such astounding frequency. The requester's concession within the technique causes them to feel more responsible for having "dictated" the final agreement. A person who feels responsible for the terms of a contract will be more likely to live up to that contract.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
如果一个协议的达成是通过对方的让步得来的，人们对这个协议会更满意。

It appears that an agreement that has been forged through the concessions of one's opponent is quite satisfying.
#+end_quote
* 第三章：承诺和一致（Commitment and Consistency）

#+begin_quote
……一种要与我们过去的所作所为保持一致的愿望。一旦我们做出了某个决定，或选择了某种立场，就会面对来自个人和外部的压力迫使我们的言行与它保持一致。在这种压力之下，我们会采取某种行为以证明我们之前所做的决策。

... our nearly obsessive desire to be (and to appear) consistent with what we have already done. Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment. Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our earlier decision.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
实际上，我们每一个人都会时不时地欺骗自己，好让我们的想法和信仰与我们已经做出的决定或采取的行为保持一致。这种要保持一致的驱动力会持续转化成一种杀伤力极强的社会影响力的武器。在它的影响下，我们经常会做出一些违背自己意愿的事情来。

Indeed, we all fool ourselves from time to time in order to keep our thoughts and beliefs consistent with what we have already done or decided.  The drive to be (and look) consistent constitutes a highly potent weapon of social influence, often causing us to act in ways that are clearly contrary to our own best interests.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
在大多数情况下，保持一致都是一种最具适应性、最受尊重的行为。前后不一通常被认为是一种不良的品行。保持一致的认同度有时比做得正确的认同度还要高。

In most circumstances consistency is valued and adaptive. Inconsistency is commonly thought to be an undesirable personality trait. Being consistent is approved "sometimes more than being right".
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
在一次讲演之后，有人问法拉第，他是否在暗示他对手的观点总是错误的，法拉第不屑地答道：「他可不是那么始终如一！」

When asked after a lecture if he meant to imply that a hated academic rival was always wrong, Faraday glowered at the questioner and replied, "He's not that consistent."
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
我们不难理解为什么下意识地保持一致是一种难以控制的反应，它为我们提供了一种逃避冥思苦想的方法，好让我们能够应对那些复杂的日常环境。

It is not hard to understand, then, why automatic consistency is a difficult reaction to curb. It offers us a way to evade the rigors of continuing thought. It allows us a convenient, relatively effortless, and efficient method for dealing with complex daily environments.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
有时候，让我们逃避思考的不是思考过程的艰辛，而是经过深入思考所得出的清晰而不受欢迎的结论让我们懒得去思考这个问题。对于一些令人烦恼的事情，我们宁愿视而不见。

Sometimes it is not the effort of hard, cognitive work that makes us shirk thoughtful activity, it is the cursedly clear and unwelcome set of answers provided by straight thinking that makes us mental slackers. There are certain disturbing things we simply would rather not realize.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
「玩具公司的小伎俩，它们在圣诞节前就开始为一些特别的玩具做一些很吸引人的广告……故意不充分供应这些玩具。大部分家长只好买一种价格差不多的玩具来代替。圣诞节之后，这些公司又开始为那些特别的玩具做起广告来。那些小家伙会跑到父母那里，哭着说「你答应过我的。」家长们为履行他们的诺言，只好跑到玩具店里去买了。」

"... how several of the big toy companies jack up their sales. They start prior to Christmas with attractive TV ads for certain special toys. They undersupply the stores with the toys they've gotten the parents to promise. Most parents find those things sold out and are forced to substitute other toys of equal value. Then, after Christmas, the companies start running the ads again for the other, special toys. ... the kids go running to their parents whining, 'You promised, you promised,' and the adults go trudging off to the store to live up dutifully to their words."
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
这种开始时提出很小的请求，为的是让对方最终答应那些更大的、与之相关的请求的策略叫做「先诱敌上钩法」。

The tactic of starting with a little request in order to gain eventual compliance with related larger requests has a name: the foot-in-the-door technique.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
……人们对参与的活动或采取的行动有了不同的感觉。一旦他同意了某个请求，他的态度就会发生改变，他会变成他心目中的那种人。一旦一个人的自我形象发生了改变，就会给那些想要利用这种新形象的人带来可乘之机。

What may occur is a change in the person's feelings about getting involved or taking action. Once he has agreed to a request, his attitude may change, he may become, in his own eyes, the kind of person who ... And once a person's self-image is altered, all sorts of subtle advantages become available to someone who wants to exploit that new image.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
一个人的行为比言语更能暴露他的真实想法……我们也会用同样的依据来判断自己是什么样的人，也就是说，行为是人们用来判断自己的信仰、价值观和态度的最主要的依据。

Our best evidence of what people truly feel and believe comes less from their words than from their deeds. ... man himself uses this same evidence to decide what he is like. His behavior tells him about himself; it is a primary source of information about his beliefs and values and attitudes.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
旁人对我们的看法会极大地影响我们对自己的认识。

What those around us think is true of us is enormously important in determining what we ourselves think is true.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
一旦人们主动做出了一个承诺，自我形象就会受到一致性原理的双重压力。一是来自内心的压力，它迫使我们的所作所为要与我们的形象保持一致；另一方面来自外界的无形的压力，它要求我们要按照他人的看法来调整自己的形象。

Once an active commitment is made, then, self-image is squeezed from both sides by consistency pressures. From the inside, there is a pressure to bring self-image into line with action. From the outside, there is a sneakier pressure ― a tendency to adjust this image according to the way others perceive us.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
一个公开做出的承诺更有可能导致以后固执地保持一致的行为。

... public commitments can lead to doggedly consistent further action.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
履行一个承诺所要付出的努力越多，这个承诺对许诺者的影响就越大。与不费吹灰之力就能得到的那些东西相比，人们更加珍惜那些来之不易的东西。

The more effort that goes into a commitment, the greater is its ability to influence the attitudes of the person who made it. Persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
这样一来，那些入会仪式中的折磨、劳顿、甚至是毒打终于开始显得有点道理了……他们都不是丧心病狂的人，他们是为了群体的生存才这样做的。虽然听起来有些荒谬，但这种行为却能让未来的成员觉得这个团体更有价值、更有吸引力。

Now the harassments, the exertions, even the beatings of initiation rituals begin to make sense. ... these are not acts of sadism. They are acts of group survival. They function, oddly enough, to spur future society members to find the group more attractive and worthwhile.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
当一个承诺具有主动性、公开性并且需要付出更多的努力才能得到时，它更容易改变一个人的自我形象和未来行为。

It appears that commitments are most effective in changing a person's self-image and future behavior when they are active, public, and effortful.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
当我们在没有外界压力的情况下做出选择时，便会发自内心地要对这个选择负责。

We accept inner responsibility for a behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in the absence of strong outside pressures.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
当我们想要孩子真正相信一件事情时，我们不应该去贿赂或者威胁他们。如果我们想让孩子们相信他们的做法是对的，想让他们当我们不在场时仍能这么做，那我们就得想办法让他们从内心深处对这个行为负责。

We should never heavily bribe or threaten our children to do the things we want them truly to believe in. If we want the children to believe in the correctness of what they have done, if we want them to continue to perform the desired behavior when we are not present to apply those outside pressures, then we must somehow arrange for them to accept inner responsibility for the actions we want them to take.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
……告诉他们玩这个机器人是不对的，但如果他们不遵守他的命令，也不会受到什么惩罚……这些小男孩对在那段时间内做出的不玩那个机器人的选择承担起责任，他们断定自己之所以没有玩那个机器人，是因为他们不想玩。

... instructed them that playing with the robot was wrong, but he had added no threat of punishment should they disobey him. ... the boys took personal responsibility for their choice to stay away from the robot during that time. They decided that they hadn't played with it because they didn't want to.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
「撒谎是很坏的，所以我希望你不要说谎，因为如果你撒谎的话，我会很失望的。」聪明的父母知道什么样的理由会对他们的孩子起作用。这个理由既要能够让孩子们按照父母的要求去做，又要能够让他们对自己的行为负责。它包含的可察觉的外部压力越少，它的效果也就越好。这个理由有可能就是短暂顺从和长期承诺之间的分界线。

"It's bad to lie, so I hope you won't do it, because if you do, I'll be disappointed in you." Wise parents will know which kind of reason will work on their own children. The important thing is to use a reason that will initially produce the desired behavior and will, at the same time, allow a child to take personal responsibility for that behavior. Thus, the less detectable outside pressure such a reason contains, the better. It is likely to mean the difference between short-lived compliance and long-term commitment.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
他们会给顾客开出一个好价钱。事实上，他们从来就没有打算过要以这个价钱成交。他们给出这个价格的唯一目的，就是让顾客做出从他们这里买车的决定。一旦顾客做出了这个决定，销售员便会采取一系列的行动来让顾客产生对这辆车的承诺感。在这一段时间里，这些顾客会下意识地找出一大堆理由来支持自己所做出的选择。接着，在顾客做出决定之后，但还没有最后成交之前，最初给出的那个诱惑却被巧妙地拿掉了。

For certain customers, a very good price is offered. However, the dealer never intends it to go through. Its only purpose is to cause a prospect to decide to buy one of the dealership's cars. Once the decision is made, a number of activities develop the customer's sense of personal commitment to the car. During this time, customers automatically develop a range of new reasons to support the choice they have now made. Then, sometime after the decision has been made but before the bargain is sealed, the original purchase advantage is deftly removed.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
个人承诺有能力建立起它自己的支持系统，而这套支持系统会为这个承诺提供一套新的理论依据。因此，即使挪走了最初支持这个承诺的那一支柱，这个承诺也不会坍塌……他们从来没有意识到，如果没有最初的那个承诺，那些额外的理由可能永远也不会出现。

... the ability of a personal commitment to build its own support system, a support system of new justifications for the commitment. ... that when pulls away only one leg, the original one, there is no collapse. It never occurs to the buyer that those additional reasons might never have existed had the choice not been made in the first place.

在所有支持他们节约能源的理由中，登报表扬是唯一一个来自外部的因素。它不能让这些人认为自己节约用气是因为自己真正相信这件事。所以当那封取消登报表扬的信寄来之后，就铲除了阻碍他们成为关心公共利益和能源问题的公民的唯一障碍。这个无条件的、全新的自我形象又推动他们在节约能源上达到一个新的高度。

Of all the reasons supporting the decision to try to save fuel, it was the only one that had come from the outside; it was the only one preventing the homeowners from thinking that they were conserving gas because they believed in it. So when the letter arrived canceling the publicity agreement, it removed the only impediment to these residents' images of themselves as fully concerned, energy-conscious citizens. This unqualified, new self-image then pushed them to even greater heights of conservation.

* 第四章：社会认同（Social Proof）

#+begin_quote
我们进行是非标准判断的标准之一就是看别人是怎么想的。如果我们看到别人在某种场合做某件事情，我们就会断定这样做是有道理的。周围人的做法对我们决定自己应该如何行动具有很重要的指导作用。

One means we use to determine what is correct is to find out what other people think is correct. We view a behavior as more correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it. ... the actions of those around us will be important in defining the answer.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
然而，在观察他人的反应以消除我们的不确定性的过程中，我们很可能忽略了一个细小但很重要的事实，那就是为了消除自己的不确定性，他人可能也正在观察别人的反应。这种每个人都希望看看别人在做什么的倾向会导致一种名为「多元无知」的有趣现象……一种让人感到费解而又耻辱的现象：当一名受害者在痛苦中挣扎着需要帮助的时候，却没有一个旁观泽伸出援手。

In the process of examining the reactions of other people to resolve our uncertainty, however, we are likely to overlook a subtle but important fact. Those people are probably examining the social evidence, too. The tendency for everyone to be looking to see what everyone else is doing can lead to a fascinating phenomenon called "pluralistic ignorance." ... a regular occurrence that has been termed both a riddle and a national disgrace: the failure of entire groups of bystanders to aid victims in agonizing need of help.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
有时候要判断一件事是否紧急并不容易。当我们碰到这种不确定的情况时，自然就会先去看周围其他人的反应。从其他人的反应中，我们可以知道这件事情到底是不是紧急。

Very often an emergency is not obviously an emergency. In times of such uncertainty, the natural tendency is to look around at the actions of others for clues. We can learn, from the way the other witnesses are reacting, whether the event is or is not an emergency.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
因为我们都喜欢在他人面前表现得信心十足、不慌不忙，因此在寻找认同时也是不动声色。结果每个人都是一副镇定自若的样子，而且没有采取任何行动。于是，在社会认同原理的作用下，这件事情就被解释成了一个非紧急事件。

Because we all prefer to appear poised and unflustered among others, we are likely to search for that evidence placidly. Therefore everyone is likely to see everyone else looking unruffled and failing to act. As a result, and by the principle of social proof, the event will be roundly interpreted as a nonemergency.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
对一个紧急事件的受害者来说，在场的人越多越好的想法通常是大错特错。对那些身处险境需要帮助的人而言，如果只有一个而不是一群人在场的话，或许他得救的机会还要大一些。

For the emergency victim, the idea of "safety in numbers" may often be completely wrong. It might be that someone in need of emergency aid would have a better chance of survival if a single bystander, rather than a crowd, was present.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
混乱、人口稠密、认识率低这三个城市环境的自然特征，恰好与研究发现的降低旁观者帮助率的因素相吻合。

These three natural characteristics of urban environments ― their confusion, their populousness, and their low levels of acquaintanceship ― fit in very well with the factors shown by research to decrease bystander aid.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
重要的是要认识到，旁观者没有采取行动并不是因为冷漠无情或缺乏善意，而是因为他们对当前的情况不够了解。

The key is the realization that groups of bystanders fail to help because the bystanders are unsure rather than unkind.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
作为一名受害者，除了让旁观者知道你需要紧急的帮助之外，你还要更进一步，帮他们搞清楚他们应该如何帮助你以及由谁来帮助你。……从人群中挑出一个人来，盯着他，指着他，直接对他说：「你，穿蓝夹克的先生，我需要帮助，请叫一辆救护车来。」

As a victim you must do more than alert bystanders to your need for emergency assistance; you must also remove their uncertainties about how that assistance should be provided and who should provide it. ... isolate one individual from the crowd: Stare, speak, and point directly at that person and no one else: "You, sir, in the blue jacket, I need help. Call an ambulance."
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
……减少周围人对你的处境和他们的责任的不确定性。尽可能准确地将你需要的帮助表达出来。不要让旁观者自己去下结论。

... reduce the uncertainties of those around you concerning your condition and their responsibilities. Be as precise as possible about your need for aid. Do not allow bystanders to come to their own conclusions.

The single act in the history of the People's Temple that most contributed to the members' mindless compliance that day occurred a year earlier with the relocation of the Temple to a jungled country of unfamiliar customs and strange people.

#+begin_quote
特百惠公司的家庭聚会是全美国人采用的让人顺从的手段中的典范……影响力的武器：互惠（在开始买东西之前，每个人都得到了一份礼物），承诺（每个参加聚会的人都要当众描述他自己使用特百惠产品的好处），社会认同（既然跟我一样的其他人都买它的产品，那这些产品一定很不错）。

... the Tupperware party ... the quintessential American compliance setting ... weapons of influence : reciprocity (everyone receives a gift before the buying begins), commitment (each participant is urged to describe publicly the uses and benefits she has found in the Tupper-ware she already owns), and social proof (other, similar people want the product, therefore, it must be good).

推销员采用一种「无穷链」的方法去发现新顾客。一旦顾客承认喜欢某件商品，销售人员就会劝他提供几个可能想要了解这种产品的朋友的名字。然后推销人员就会去拜访名单上的这些人。这个过程会一直进行下去，无穷无尽。这种办法成功的关键在于，推销员被一个「建议我来拜访您」的朋友的名字武装起来，在这种情况下要把推销员赶走是比较困难的，因为这就像在拒绝一个朋友。

... salespeople to use the "endless chain" method for finding new customers. Once a customer admits to liking a product, he or she can be pressed for the names of friends who would also appreciate learning about it. The individuals on that list can then be approached ... and so on in an endless chain. The key to the success of this method is that each new prospect is visited by a salesperson armed with the name of a friend "who suggested I call on you." Turning the salesperson away under those circumstances is difficult; it's almost like rejecting the friend.

We like people who are similar to us. This fact seems to hold true whether the similarity is in the area of opinions, personality traits, background, or life-style. A way requesters can manipulate similarity to increase liking and compliance is to claim that they have backgrounds and interests similar to ours.

一个很有趣的现象：你的朋友会喜欢你真实相貌的照片，而你自己则喜欢那张左右脸互换的照片。因为不论是你还是你的朋友都在选择自己更为熟悉的那张脸，对你的朋友来说这是整个世界看到的那个你；而对你自己来说，这是从镜子里看到的你。

（在小男孩之间）造成一种不和谐的局面一点也不难，只要把人分成两组，听之任之地让他们去折腾就行了。……一种非常简单也非常有效的解决办法，就是创造出一种竞争对双方都有害的环境，为了共同利益，他们必须合作。

... the recipe for disharmony was quick and easy : Just separate the participants into groups and let sit for a while in their own juices ... a resolution that was at once simple and effective ... constructed a series of situations in which competition between the groups would have harmed everyone's interests, in which cooperation was necessary for mutual benefit.

Something that, on its own merits, held little appeal for me had become decidedly more attractive merely because it would soon become unavailable.

心理抗拒会在2岁左右出现。这可能与大多数孩子要在这年龄段经历一次心理上的变化有关。在这个时候，孩子们开始全面地意识到自己是一个个体。一个独立的人是有他自己的选择的，而有了这种新的认识的孩子们，就想扩大他们选择的范围……他们求知的过程。通过认真地测定他们的自由和父母的耐心的极限，他们正在发现哪里是不可逾越的禁区，哪里自己拥有支配的权力。

在一种信息被禁止以后，我们总是更想获得这种信息，而且往往会对它做出更高的评价。具讽刺意味的是，对诸如一些偏激的政治团体的成员来说，为了让人们接受他们的观点，最有效的策略不是去公开宣扬这些观点，而是故意让这些观点遭受官方的封杀，然后再把遭到封杀的消息公之于众。

Almost invariably, our response to the banning of information is a greater desire to receive that information and a more favorable attitude toward it than before the ban. The irony is that for such people ― members of fringe political groups, for example ― the most effective strategy may not be to publicize their unpopular views, but to get those views officially censored and then to publicize the censorship.
