通信的基本问题是，在一点精确地或近似地复现在另一点所选取的讯息。这些讯息往往都带有意义。 —— 克劳德·香农，《通信的数学理论》

The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning. — Claude Shannon

1948 年，贝尔电话实验室发明的晶体管引发了电子产业的革命，为电子技术的微型化和普遍应用开辟了道路，而它的三位主要发明人也很快获得了诺贝尔奖。《通信的数学理论》是个支点，整个地球都将因此而被撬动。和晶体管一样，这项研究也引入了一个新词：比特，用于测量信息的单位。

1948 was when the Bell Telephone Laboratories ... the transistor sparked the revolution in electronics, setting the technology on its path of miniaturization and ubiquity, and soon won the Nobel Prize for its three chief inventors. "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" was a fulcrum around which the world began to turn. Like the transistor, this development also involved a neologism: the word bit, a unit for measuring information.

在 22 岁那年，香农在硕士论文中把一个 19 世纪的思想，即乔治·布尔的逻辑代数，应用到了电子电路的设计上。

At twenty-two he wrote a dissertation that applied a nineteenth-century idea, George Boole's algebra of logic, to the design of electrical circuits.

回首三个世纪前，当时物理学的发展已经到了难以突破的地步，但随着艾萨克·牛顿将一些古老但意义模糊的词（力、质量、运动，甚至时间）赋予新的含义，物理学的新时代开始了。牛顿把这些术语加以量化，以便能够放在数学方程中使用。……到了 19 世纪，energy（能）一词也开始经历相似的转变过程：自然哲学家选取这个原本用来表示生动有力或强度的词，使之数学化，从而赋予了它在物理学家自然观中的基础地位。

Three centuries earlier, the new discipline of physics could not proceed until Isaac Newton appropriated words that were ancient and vague — force, mass, motion, and even time — and gave them new meanings. Newton made these terms into quantities, suitable for use in mathematical formulas. ... In the nineteenth century, energy began to undergo a similar transformation: natural philosophers adapted a word meaning vigor or intensity. They mathematicized it, giving energy its fundamental place in the physicists' view of nature.

信息这个词……加以简化、精练，并以比特度量后，人们发现信息几乎无处不在。香农的理论在信息与不确定性、信息与熵，以及信息与混沌之间架起了桥梁。它的出现最终引发了光盘和传真机、电脑和网络、摩尔定律以及世界各地的「硅巷」。信息处理、信息存储以及信息检索等也应运而生。人们开始将铁器时代和蒸汽时代之后的时代称为信息时代。

Information ... when it was made simple, distilled, counted in bits, information was found to be everywhere. Shannon's theory made a bridge between information and uncertainty; between information and entropy; and between information and chaos. It led to compact discs and fax machines, computers and cyberspace, Moore's law and all the world's Silicon Alleys. Information processing was born, along with information storage and information retrieval. People began to name a successor to the Iron Age and the Steam Age.

DNA 是信息分子的典型代表，是细胞层次上最先进的讯息处理器——它是一份字母表、一种编码，用 60 亿比特的信息定义了一个人。……「处于所有生物核心的不是火，不是热气，也不是所谓的「生命火花」，而是信息、字词以及指令……如果你想了解生命，就别去研究那些生机勃勃、动来动去的原生质了，从信息技术的角度想想吧。」生物体中的所有细胞都是一个错综复杂的通信网络中的节点，它们一刻不停地传输和接受信息，不停地编码和解码。进化本身正是生物体与环境之间持续不断的信息交换的具体表现。

DNA is the quintessential information molecule, the most advanced message processor at the cellular level — an alphabet and a code, 6 billion bits to form a human being. "What lies at the heart of every living thing is not a fire, not warm breath, not a "spark of life". It is information, words, instructions.… If you want to understand life, don't think about vibrant, throbbing gels and oozes, think about information technology." The cells of an organism are nodes in a richly interwoven communications network, transmitting and receiving, coding and decoding. Evolution itself embodies an ongoing exchange of information between organism and environment.

#+begin_quote
基因在文化上的对应物是模因。在文化的演化过程中，模因扮演着复制者和传播者的角色——它可能是一股思潮、一阵时尚、一封「连锁信」，又或是一种阴谋论。

The gene has its cultural analog, too: the meme. In cultural evolution, a meme is a replicator and propagator — an idea, a fashion, a chain letter, or a conspiracy theory.

#+begin_quote
即便是在货币看上去是一种物质财富，……它也是一种信息。无论是硬币、纸币，还是金币、贝壳，它们都只不过是阶段性的技术，用以表明谁拥有什么的信息。

Even when money seemed to be material treasure, ... it always was information. Coins and notes, shekels and cowries were all just short-lived technologies for tokenizing information about who owns what.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
「万物源自比特」。……「我们所谓的实在，是在对一系列「是」或「否」的追问综合分析后才在我们脑中成形的。所有实体之物，在起源上都是信息理论意义上的，而这个宇宙是个观察者参与其中的宇宙。」因此，整个宇宙可以看作一台计算机——一台巨大的信息处理机器。……当光子、电子以及其他基本粒子发生相互作用时，它们实际是在做什么呢？其实是在交换比特、转换量子态以及处理信息，而物理定律就是处理信息时所用的算法。因此，每一颗正在燃烧的恒星、每一个星云、每一粒在云室中留下幽灵般痕迹的粒子，都是一台信息处理器，而宇宙也在计算着自己的命运。……宇宙的运算能力「不会超过在 10^90 个比特上执行 10^120 次基本逻辑运算」。

"It from Bit." ... "What we call reality, arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions. All things physical are information-theoretic in origin, and this is a participatory universe." The whole universe is thus seen as a computer — a cosmic information-processing machine. ... When photons and electrons and other particles interact, what are they really doing? Exchanging bits, transmitting quantum states, processing information. The laws of physics are the algorithms. Every burning star, every silent nebula, every particle leaving its ghostly trace in a cloud chamber is an information processor. The universe computes its own destiny. ... "No more than 10^120 ops on 10^90 bits."

#+begin_quote
普罗米修斯赠予人类的最宝贵的礼物，到底还不是火种：「……数，……所有科学中最最重要的，还有排列字母的技术，……借此可以把一切都牢牢记住。」字母表是诸信息技术中的奠基性技术。而电话机、传真机、机械计算器，以及最终的电脑，它们只是用以存储、操作和传递知识的种种工具中的晚近发明。

The greatest gift of Prometheus to humanity was not fire after all: "Numbers, ... chiefest of sciences, and the combining of letters, ... with which to hold all things in memory." The alphabet was a founding technology of information. The telephone, the fax machine, the calculator, and, ultimately, the computer are only the latest innovations devised for saving, manipulating, and communicating knowledge.

#+begin_quote
每一种新出现的信息技术，都在当时催生了信息存储和传输的新需求。随着印刷术的发明，出现了新的信息组织工具，如汇编词汇的字典、梳理知识的百科全书，以及整理事实的年鉴等。……「印刷术的发明，固然是天才之举，然而较之于字母的发明，并没什么大不了。」……每一种新出现的媒介，都会对人类思维的性质加以改造。长远来看，所谓历史，就是信息逐步从自发到自觉的一个过程。

Each new information technology, in its own time, set off blooms in storage and transmission. From the printing press came new species of information organizers: dictionaries, cyclopaedias, almanacs — compendiums of words, classifiers of facts, trees of knowledge. ... "The invention of printing, though ingenious, compared with the invention of letters is no great matter." ...  Every new medium transforms the nature of human thought. In the long run, history is the story of information becoming aware of itself.

#+begin_quote
讯息的意义必须预先约定，并精简到一个比特。换句话说，必须是个非此即彼的二元选择，有事或无事：火光燃起，表示有事；这一次，它表示「特洛伊城已被攻陷」。传递这一个比特信息，需要用到周密的计划、高度的警觉，以及大量的人力和薪柴。很多很多年后，在美国独立战争爆发前夜，波士顿旧北区教堂的灯笼也同样给保罗·里维尔传递了一个珍贵的比特：一盏灯代表英国人走陆路，两盏灯代表英国人走海路。

The meaning of the message had, of course, to be prearranged, effectively condensed into a single bit. A binary choice, something or nothing: the fire signal meant something, which, just this once, meant "Troy has fallen." To transmit this one bit required immense planning, labor, watchfulness, and firewood. Many years later, lanterns in Old North Church likewise sent Paul Revere a single precious bit, which he carried onward, one binary choice: by land or by sea.

#+begin_quote
……他们考虑了一种基于两个元素的系统：一个是点击（现在称为点），另一个是点击之间的停顿。后来，他们……萌发了加入第三个元素的想法：线或划，以「电路闭合的时间比发送一个点更长」来表示。这种编码后来被称为点–划字母表，但没有提及的停顿也同等重要，因此，摩尔斯电码并不是一种二进制语言。

... they conceived of a system built on two elements: the clicks (now called dots) and the spaces in between. Then, ... they came up with a third sign: the line or dash, "when the circuit was closed a longer time than was necessary to make a dot." The code became known as the dot-and-dash alphabet, but the unmentioned space remained just as important; Morse code was not a binary language.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
……为了提高速度，他们可以设计让最常用的字母对应较短的编码，以减少击键的次数。但哪些字母才是最常用的呢？在当时，人们对于字母的使用频率还未作过统计。……拜访了……一家当地报社。……仔细查看了他们使用的铅字盘，发现备货中有一万两千个 E、九千个 T，但只有两百个 Z。他和摩尔斯据此调整了字母编码。

In the name of speed, ... they could save strokes by reserving the shorter sequences of dots and dashes for the most common letters. But which letters would be used most often? Little was known about the alphabet's statistics. ... visit the local newspaper office ... and look over the type cases. He found a stock of twelve thousand E's, nine thousand T's, and only two hundred Z's. He and Morse rearranged the alphabet accordingly.

#+begin_quote
摩尔斯的系统建立在一个中间符号层，也就是字母表的基础上。字母表将口语和他最终的编码联系了起来。摩尔斯的点–划编码，与口语语音并无直接联系。点–划编码仅仅用来表示字母，字母再组成书面单词，最终书面单词才表示口语中的单词。非洲的鼓手们就没有这么一种中间编码可用，无法通过一个中间符号层来完成这样的抽象，毕竟就像目前世界上现存六千多种语言中的大部分，非洲的各种语言没有字母表。鼓语其实是口语的一种变形。

Morse had bootstrapped his system from a middle symbolic layer, the written alphabet, intermediate between speech and his final code. His dots and dashes had no direct connection to sound; they represented letters, which formed written words, which represented the spoken words in turn. The drummers could not build on an intermediate code — they could not abstract through a layer of symbols — because the African languages, like all but a few dozen of the six thousand languages spoken in the modern world, lacked an alphabet. The drums metamorphosed speech.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
……鼓手总是会为每个单词加上一些「小短语」以示区分。比如，单词「月亮」可以表示成「那俯览大地的月亮」。单词「鸡」可以表示成「鸡，那啾啾叫的小东西」。这些额外的鼓点，可不是画蛇添足，正是它们提供了上下文信息。

... a drummer would invariably add "a little phrase" to each short word. Songe,
the moon, is rendered as "the moon looks down at the earth." Koko, the fowl, is rendered "the fowl, the little one that says kiokio." The extra drumbeats, far from being extraneous, provide context.

引入冗余，不言而喻，效率肯定会打折扣，但它是避免混淆的一剂良药，它提供了第二次机会。事实上，每一种自然语言都内在地包含冗余，这也是为什么人们可以读懂错别字连篇的文章，可以在嘈杂的房间里听懂交谈内容的原因。

Redundancy — inefficient by definition — serves as the antidote to confusion. It provides second chances. Every natural language has redundancy built in; this is why people can understand text riddled with errors and why they can understand conversation in a noisy room.

#+begin_quote
拉尔夫·哈特利在其论文《信息的传输》中，提出了一个看上去有点相关的公式：H = nlogs ，其中 H 表示讯息的信息量，n 表示讯息中的符号数，而 s 则表示语言中可用符号的总数。……这个公式量化了一种简单现象：可用的符号越少，为表示出给定信息量所需传递的符号数就得越多。

Ralph Hartley, had a relevant-looking formula: H = n log s, where H is the amount of information, n is the number of symbols in the message, and s is the number of symbols available in the language. ... The formula quantified a simple enough phenomenon: the fewer symbols available, the more of them must be transmitted to get across a given amount of information.

#+begin_quote
经过两千多年的演化，人类已经把各种信息技术内化。……而我们人类心智中最根深蒂固难以去除的，也是位于一切技术之先的，就是文字。……人类历经数千年才把这种将语言表达成符号系统的能力内化为第二天性。而一旦习得之后，回归天真无邪的退路就不复存在了。

... the technologies of information internalized over two millennia ... The hardest technology to erase from our minds is the first of all: writing. ... It takes a few thousand years for this mapping of language onto a system of signs to become second nature, and then there is no return to naïveté.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
文字，作为一种技术，使用时需要提前考虑清楚并掌握特殊技能。而语言则不是一种技术，无论多么成熟、多么发达的语言，都不能被视作心外之物，因为语言是心智本身的功能。

Writing, as a technology, requires premeditation and special art. Language is not a technology, no matter how well developed and efficacious. It is not best seen as something separate from the mind; it is what the mind does.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
文字看上去要将知识从人那里抽离出来，要把他们的记忆存储在别处。它还使说话者和倾听者可以间隔遥远的距离或年代。……借助文字，一个人可以向众多人说话，死者可以向生者说话，生者可以向未生者说话。……这种首次出现的人工记忆，力量之大无可估算：它重构了人类思维，人类历史由此发端。……任何一种口语的词汇仅包含数千个单词，而被最广泛使用的书面语言——英语，有记录的词汇就超过百万之众，而且其数量还在以每年数千个的速度持续增长。

Writing appeared to draw knowledge away from the person, to place their memories in storage. It also separated the speaker from the listener, by so many miles or years. ... The one speaks to the multitude. The dead speak to the living, the living to the unborn. ... The power of this first artificial memory was incalculable: to restructure thought, to engender history. ... whereas the total vocabulary of any oral language measures a few thousand words, the single language that has been written most widely, English, has a documented vocabulary of well over a million words, a corpus that grows by thousands of words a year.

借助文字，我们开始像洒面包屑般在身后留下踪迹，以符号存储下记忆，供后来人追寻。蚂蚁会喷洒信息素，留下化学信息的痕迹；忒修斯会散开阿里阿德涅的线团以防止在迷宫中找不到返回的路。而现在，人们留下的则是白纸黑字的痕迹。文字来到世间，为的就是将信息保存下来，让其能跨越时空。在文字出现以前，传播不仅稍纵即逝，而且只限于狭隘的区域，因为说话声音传出数米之远后就消失无踪。

With words we begin to leave traces behind us like breadcrumbs: memories in symbols for others to follow. Ants deploy their pheromones, trails of chemical information; Theseus unwound Ariadne's thread. Now people leave paper trails. Writing comes into being to retain information across time and across space. Before writing, communication is evanescent and local; sounds carry a few yards and fade to oblivion.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
文字使得复用和「回忆」成为可能——这是全新的模式。它允许信息以全新的架构加以组织，分成诸如历史、法律、商业、数学和逻辑等。……文字的力量不仅体现在知识的保存和传承上，这自然很有价值，也体现在所用的方法论上，比如对视觉指示物加以编码、转换，利用符号替代实物，进而利用符号替代符号。

It enables reuse and "re-collection" — new modes. It permits whole new architectures of information. Among them are history, law, business, mathematics, and logic. ... The power lies not just in the knowledge, preserved and passed forward, valuable as it is, but in the methodology: encoded visual indications, the act of transference, substituting signs for things. And then, later, signs for signs.

……渐进的过程始于象形文字（书写形象），再到表意文字（书写意象），最终到语标文字（书写字词）。汉字于 4500～8000 年前就开始了这种过渡，起源于图案的符号逐渐变成表示具有意义的声音单元。……汉字统一了使用各种各样口语的人群，口语不通的人们之间可以通过文字交流。……汉字构成了人类历史上演化出来的最丰富，同时也是最复杂的文字系统。从所需符号的数量之多以及单个符号传递的意义之广来看，汉字是一种极端个案：符号集最庞大，单个符号的含义也最丰富。

... progression from pictographic, writing the picture; to ideographic, writing the idea; and then logographic, writing the word. Chinese script began this transition between 4,500 and 8,000 years ago: signs that began as pictures came to represent meaningful units of sound.  ... Chinese unifies an array of distinct spoken languages: people who cannot speak to one another can write to one another. ... The entirety is the richest and most complex writing system that humanity has ever evolved. Considering scripts in terms of how many symbols are required and how much meaning each individual symbol conveys, Chinese thus became an extreme case: the largest set of symbols, and the most meaningful individually.

位于另一极端的文字系统出现得最晚，这就是字母文字，使用一个符号代表一种最基础的声音。字母文字是所有的文字系统中最简化的、最具颠覆性的东西。……字母表在历史上仅被发明过一次。所有已知的字母表，无论是到今天还在使用的，还是写在考古发掘出来的泥板和石块上的，都只有一个共同的祖先。它起源于靠近地中海东岸的地区，时间上略早于公元前 1500 年。……占统治地位的僧侣阶层长期以来维护着他们原先的文字系统，因为谁掌握了文字，谁就掌握了法律和祭祀的支配权。……字母像传染病一样迅速传播开来。这种新技术既是病毒，又是病毒传播的载体。它既无法被垄断，也无法被抑制。……各地的文明会将各自的字母加以完善，在其中，拉丁字母和西里尔字母最终脱颖而出。

The writing system at the opposite extreme took the longest to emerge: the alphabet, one symbol for one minimal sound. The alphabet is the most reductive, the most subversive of all scripts. ... The alphabet was invented only once. All known alphabets, used today or found buried on tablets and stone, descend from the same original ancestor, which arose near the eastern littoral of the Mediterranean Sea, sometime not much before 1500 BCE. ... The ruling priestly classes were invested in their writing systems. Whoever owned the scripts owned the laws and the rites. ... The alphabet spread by contagion. The new technology was both the virus and the vector of transmission. It could not be monopolized, and it could not be suppressed. ...  The new civilization arising there brought the alphabet to a high degree of perfection. Among others, the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets followed along.

亚里士多德……着手进行了把知识系统化的工作。文字的持久性使得他能够把有关这个世界的已有知识加以结构化，进而他可以总结关于知识的知识。一旦一个人能够把字词写下来，对它们进行仔细考察，每天从全新的视角对它们加以审视，并追索它们的含义，他就成了一名哲学家。

Aristotle ... was attempting to systematize knowledge. The persistence of writing made it possible to impose structure on what was known about the world and, then, on what was known about knowing. As soon as one could set words down, examine them, look at them anew the next day, and consider their meaning, one became a philosopher.

……人类以范畴而非事件来组织经验，并自觉接受抽象化的训练。……这种过程……就是思考。因此，这不仅是人类对于自身的新发现，而且是人类思考的发端——事实上，这才是人类自我意识的真正起始。……书面文字（持久存在的文字）是我们所理解的有意识思考的前提条件。它触发了人类灵魂不可逆转的大规模变化。

... organizing experience in terms of categories rather than events; embracing the discipline of abstraction. ... this process ... was thinking. This was the discovery, not just of the self, but of the thinking self — in effect, the true beginning of consciousness. ...

口语稍纵即逝，根本来不及进行分析。逻辑是书面文字的产物，……逻辑将抽象变成了一种判断真假的工具：真理除了可以来自具体经验，仅从字面也可得出。……逻辑直接涉及符号系统：万物各属其类，而类各有经抽象和概括而来的属性。但口语文化中的人缺乏范畴的观念，比如几何形状。

Speech is too fleeting to allow for analysis. Logic descended from the written word, ... Logic turns the act of abstraction into a tool for determining what is true and what is false: truth can be discovered in words alone, apart from concrete experience. ... Logic implicates symbolism directly: things are members of classes; they possess qualities, which are abstracted and generalized. Oral people lacked the categories ... for example, for geometrical shapes.

依你所言——就这个小短语，反映出来的却是一种境界的提升。现在信息摆脱了个人经验的束缚，而存在于一个个文字当中。……会读写的人将他们对于文字的意识视为完全理所当然，类似的还有相关的一系列机制，如分类、引用和定义等。然而在文字出现以前，这些技术却完全不为人知。

To go by your words — in that phrase, a level is crossed. The information has been detached from any person, detached from the speaker's experience.

Before literacy, there is nothing obvious about such techniques.

既然悖论似乎是存在于语言之中，或是与语言相关，那么消除悖论的手段之一就是净化这个媒介：将模棱两可的字词和含混不清的句法从语言中剔除，转而采用严格而纯粹的符号。换句话说，就是要求助于数学。

正如柏拉图所说，书面文字是停滞不动的，它稳定不变、不可移动。不过，柏拉图的不安在接下去的一两千年中几乎完全无人理会，因为书面文化结出了累累硕果：历史和法律、科学和哲学，以及对于艺术和文学本身的反思性阐释等。这些成就中没有一个能在纯粹的口语文化中出现。……柏拉图见证了文字的日渐兴盛，一边肯定文字的力量，另一边却又惧怕它带来的僵化。在这位作家兼哲学家身上，我们可以看到一种悖论，而相同的悖论会注定以各种形式一再出现，因为每一种信息技术在带来益处的同时，也会引发恐惧。

The written word stands still. It is stable and immobile. Plato's qualms were mostly set aside in the succeeding millennia, as the culture of literacy developed its many gifts: history and the law; the sciences and philosophy; the reflective explication of art and literature itself. None of that could have emerged from pure orality. ... (Plato) witnessed writing's rising dominion; he asserted its force and feared its lifelessness. The writer-philosopher embodied a paradox. The same paradox was destined to reappear in different guises, each technology of information bringing its own powers and its own fears.

英语的历史始终伴随着外来语的侵蚀和充实。它最古老的核心词汇，也就是那些被认为最基础的单词，来源于盎格鲁人、撒克逊人、朱特人，这些日耳曼民族在公元五世纪时跨过北海进入英国，赶走了原来定居的凯尔特人。凯尔特语并未在盎格鲁–萨克逊语中留下多少痕迹，维京入侵者倒是带来了更多源于古诺斯语和古丹麦语的单词，如 egg、sky、anger、give、get 等。拉丁语经由基督教传教士的引介而进入英语。这些传教士所使用的罗马字母也取代了先前在欧洲中部和北部流传甚广的北欧古文字母。然后接踵而至的，是法语的影响。

History (of English) showed continual corruption and enrichment from without. Its oldest core words, the words that felt most basic, came from the language spoken by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, Germanic tribes that crossed the North Sea into England in the fifth century, pushing aside the Celtic inhabitants. Not much of Celtic penetrated the Anglo-Saxon speech, but Viking invaders brought more words from Norse and Danish: egg, sky, anger, give, get. Latin came by way of Christian missionaries; they wrote in the alphabet of the Romans, which replaced the runic scripts that spread in central and northern Europe early in the first millennium. Then came the influence of French.

Alphabetical ordering comprises a pair of procedures, one the inverse of the other: organizing a list and looking up items; sorting and searching. In either direction the procedure is recursive. The basic operation is a binary decision: greater than or less than. ...  This makes for astounding efficiency. The system scales easily to any size, the macrostructure being identical to the microstructure.

当艾萨克·牛顿开始着手他的伟大事业时，他首先遇到的问题是一些重要概念缺乏明确的定义。……如速度、力、重力，在当时也没有适当的定义。它们无法以互相解释的方式加以定义，也没有一种可见的存在能让人用手指出，更没有一本书可供查阅。

When Isaac Newton embarked on his great program, he encountered a fundamental lack of definition where it was most needed. ... Velocity, force, gravity — none of these were yet suitable. They could not be defined in terms of one another; there was nothing in visible nature at which anyone could point a finger; and there was no book in which to look them up.

词典为文字的持久性提供了正式认定，它表明一个字词的意义来自于其他的字词。这意味着，所有的字词聚集到一起，就可以形成一种互相关联的结构，因为所有的字词都是由其他的字词来定义的。这种现象在口语文化中并不存在，因为在那里语言是不可见的。只有当印刷术以及词典使语言成为一个个凸起的字符，可以被细细查看时，人们才能逐渐意识到字词的意义是互相依存，甚至是循环定义的。

The dictionary ratifies the persistence of the word. It declares that the meanings of words come from other words. It implies that all words, taken together, form an interlocking structure: interlocking, because all words are defined in terms of other words. This could never have been an issue in an oral culture, where language was barely visible. Only when printing — and the dictionary — put the language into separate relief, as an object to be scrutinized, could anyone develop a sense of word meaning as interdependent and even circular.

早在印刷术出现之前，数表就已经是书业的一部分。在 9 世纪，巴格达的阿布·阿卜杜拉·穆罕默德·伊本·穆萨·花剌子密（他的名字因「算法」一词而流传至今）制定的三角函数表西传至欧洲，东传至中国，经由手工抄写，延续了数百年。而印刷术的发明使得数表大行其道，它们自然地成为了大规模生产原始数据的首个应用。

Tables of numbers had been part of the book business even before the beginning of the print era. Working in Baghdad in the ninth century, Abu Abdullah Mohammad Ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, whose name survives in the word algorithm, devised tables of trigonometric functions that spread west across Europe and east to China, made by hand and copied by hand, for hundreds of years. Printing brought number tables into their own: they were a natural first application for the mass production of data in the raw.

一项 17 世纪的发明进一步催化了数表事业的发展。这项发明本身也是一类数，被称为对数。它是一种用作工具的数。……「对数是为了降低算术和几何问题的求解难度而发明出来的数。……采用对数，就可以避免算术运算中所有麻烦的乘法和除法，而可以用加法来代替乘法，用减法来代替除法。」

A seventeenth-century invention had catalyzed the whole enterprise. This invention was itself a species of number, given the name logarithm. It was number as tool. ... "Logarithmes are Numbers invented for the more easie working of questions in Arithmetike and Geometrie. ...

A series of numbers with a fixed difference is an arithmetic progression: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 … When the numbers are separated by a fixed ratio, the progression is geometric: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 … Set these progressions side by side, ... and the result is a crude table of logarithms — crude, because the whole-number exponents are the easy ones.

Kepler's tables were far more accurate — perhaps thirty times more — than any of his medieval predecessors, and the accuracy made possible an entirely new thing, his harmonious heliocentric system, with planets orbiting the sun in ellipses.

巴贝奇……计划建造一台新的机器，仍然是计算机器，却完全属于不同种类。他将这台新机器称为分析机。这样做的动力源自他对于差分机局限性的清晰认识：仅仅通过相加差分，并不能计算出每一种数，或解决每一个数学问题。而启发他灵感的正是在河岸街展出的雅卡尔提花机，这台机器通过编码并存储在打孔卡片上的指令进行控制。引发巴贝奇想象的不是布匹的纺织过程，而是将布匹的图案从一种媒介转换到另一种媒介的编码过程。

Babbage ... was planning a new machine, still an engine of computation but transmuted into another species. He called this the Analytical Engine. Motivating him was a quiet awareness of the Difference Engine's limitations: it could not, merely by adding differences, compute every sort of number or solve any mathematical problem. Inspiring him, as well, was the loom on display in the Strand, invented by Joseph-Marie Jacquard, controlled by instructions encoded and stored as holes punched in cards.

一开始，人类根本无法驱使电来完成任何工作。它无法使一盏灯发出比一束火花更亮的光，也发不出声音。但人们很早就发现，电可以沿着电线被传播到很远，并似乎会使电线成为一个微弱的磁体。而这样的电线可以很长，还没有人发现电流的传播距离有任何极限。人们马上认识到这对自古以来梦想的远距离通信意味着什么。

In human hands, electricity could hardly accomplish anything, at first. It could not make a light brighter than a spark. It was silent. But it could be sent along wires to great distances — this was discovered early — and it seemed to turn wires into faint magnets. Those wires could be long: no one had found any limit to the range of the electric current. It took no time at all to see what this meant for the ancient dream of long-distance communication.

The Morse system of dots and dashes was not called a code at first. It was just called an alphabet. ... But it was not an alphabet. It did not represent sounds by signs.

This process — the transferring of meaning from one symbolic level to another — already had a place in mathematics. In a way it was the very essence of mathematics. Now it became a familiar part of the human toolkit. Entirely because of the telegraph, by the late nineteenth century people grew comfortable, or at least familiar, with the idea of codes: signs used for other signs, words used for other words.

A difference could be "two Bells of different Notes; or "any Object of Sight, whether Flame, Smoak, etc."; or trumpets, cannons, or drums. Any difference meant a binary choice. Any binary choice began the expressing of cogitations.

Russell's paradoxical set relies on a meta-set: a set of sets. So the problem was a crossing of levels, or, as Russell termed it, a mixing of types. His solution: declare it illegal, taboo, out of bounds. No mixing different levels of abstraction. No self-reference; no self-containment.

《数学原理》这部巨著体现的是一个曾短暂占据主流、无所不包的形式体系，……在 PM 里，「人们只需运用一些机械的规则就能证明任何定理。」之所以敢说任何定理，是因为这套体系曾经是（或至少曾经号称是）完全的。而所谓机械的规则，是因为逻辑学的运算冰冷无情，毫无个性化阐述的余地。它的符号被抽离了意义，它的证明可以被任何人一步一步地加以检验，只需他遵循一定的规则，却无需理解它。

Principia Mathematica, the great opus, embodied a formal system that had become, in its brief lifetime, so comprehensive and so dominant ... In PM, "One can prove any theorem using nothing but a few mechanical rules." Any theorem: for the system was, or claimed to be, complete. Mechanical rules: for the logic operated inexorably, with no room for varying human interpretation. Its symbols were drained of meaning. Anyone could verify a proof step by step, by following the rules, without understanding it.

（哥德尔）相信 PM 这个瓶子是完美的，但也怀疑数学是否真的可以被这个瓶子所完全包含。最终这个瘦弱的年轻人证明了自己的怀疑，作出了一项伟大而惊人的发现。他发现，在 PM 以及任何自洽的逻辑体系中，必定潜藏着某些迄今为止尚无人意识到的怪物：一些既不能被证实，但也不能被证伪的命题。也就是说，必然存在一些无法被证实的真理——而哥德尔可以证明这一点。……哥德尔证明了，一个自洽的形式体系必定是不完全的，不可能存在完全且自洽的形式体系。……对于悖论的分析揭示了一个「有趣的事实」，即「我们的逻辑直觉（比如与真理、概念、存在、类等相关的直觉）竟是自相矛盾的」。

There must be truths, that is, that cannot be proved — and Gödel could prove it. ... Thus Gödel showed that a consistent formal system must be incomplete; no complete and consistent system can exist. ... an "amazing fact" — "that our logical intuitions (i.e., intuitions concerning such notions as: truth, concept, being, class, etc.) are self-contradictory."

Alan Turing ... posed an entirely different question (it seemed): Are all numbers computable? ... Most numbers that people work with, or think about, are computable by definition. The rational numbers are computable because they can be expressed as the quotient of two integers, a/b. The algebraic numbers are computable because they are solutions of polynomial equations. Famous numbers like Π and e are computable; people compute them all the time. Nonetheless Turing made the seemingly mild statement that numbers might exist that are somehow nameable, definable, and not computable.

Turing's machines, stripped down to a finite table of states and a finite set of input, could themselves be represented as numbers. Every possible state table, combined with its initial tape, represents a different machine. Each machine itself, then, can be described by a particular number — a certain state table combined with its initial tape. ...

图灵最终（还是在脑子里）制造了一种机器，它可以模拟其他任何可能的图灵机——任何一部数字计算机。他把这部机器称为 U ，取自「通用的」一词，这个说法也被数学家一直沿用至今。通用图灵机接受机器编号作为输入，也就是说，它可以从纸带上读取对其他机器的描述（这个数描述了其算法和输入）。无论一部数字计算机变得如何复杂，对它的描述都可以被编码后写入纸带，并由 U 读取。如果一个问题可以使用一部数字计算机来解决，也就是说，它能被编码成一组符号并通过一个算法来解决，那么这个问题也可以使用通用图灵机来解决。

Turing produced (still in his mind's eye) a version of the machine that could simulate every other possible machine — every digital computer. He called this machine U, for "universal," and mathematicians fondly use the name U to this day. It takes machine numbers as input.

No matter how complex a digital computer may grow, its description can still be encoded on tape to be read by U. If a problem can be solved by any digital computer — encoded in symbols and solved algorithmically — the universal machine can solve it as well.

The Turing machine sets about examining every number to see whether it corresponds to a computable algorithm. Some will prove computable. Some might prove uncomputable. And there is a third possibility, the one that most interested Turing. Some algorithms might defy the inspector, causing the machine to march along, performing its inscrutable business, never coming to a halt, never obviously repeating itself, and leaving the logical observer forever in the dark about whether it would halt. ... because every number corresponds to an encoded proposition of mathematics and logic, Turing had resolved Hilbert's question about whether every proposition is decidable. He had proved that the Entscheidungsproblem has an answer, and the answer is no. An uncomputable number is, in effect, an undecidable proposition.

在香农看来，模式就等同于冗余。……在英语中，一个简单的例子是，紧跟在字母 q 后面的字母 u 就是冗余，即便把它去掉也不会有影响。……在字母 q 之后，大家都预期后面会是字母 u。这里面不存在什么意外，它也就没有贡献什么信息。紧跟在字母 t 后面的字母 h 也有一定的冗余度，因为它是最可能在此出现的字母。香农认为，每一种语言都有一定的统计结构，以及相应一定的冗余度。我们可以用 D 来表示冗余度。「在某种意义上，D 度量了某种语言的文本在不损失任何信息的前提下能够缩减多少篇幅。」香农估计，英语的冗余度大约是百分之五十。

Pattern, as Shannon saw it, equals redundancy. ... As a simple example in English, wherever the letter q appears, the u that follows is redundant. ... After q, a u is expected. There is no surprise. It contributes no information. After the letter t, an h has a certain amount of redundancy, because it is the likeliest letter to appear. Every language has a certain statistical structure, Shannon argued, and with it a certain redundancy. Let us call this D. "D measures, in a sense, how much a text in the language can be reduced in length without losing any information." Shannon estimated that English has redundancy of about 50 percent.

如果信息被剥除了语义内容，那么剩下的又是什么呢？……信息是不确定性，是出人意料，是困难程度，是熵。「信息与不确定性密切相关。」反过来，不确定性可以通过统计可能讯息的数量加以度量。如果仅有一条可能讯息，那么这其中就不存在不确定性，因而也就不包含信息了。有一些讯息出现的可能性比其他讯息要大，而信息意味着出人意料。出人意料其实讲的是概率。比如在英语中，如果紧跟在字母 t 之后的是字母 h，那么这其中的信息量就不大，因为字母 h 在此出现的概率相对较高。

If information was divorced from semantic content, what was left? ... Information is uncertainty, surprise, difficulty, and entropy. "Information is closely associated with uncertainty." Uncertainty, in turn, can be measured by counting the number of possible messages. If only one message is possible, there is no uncertainty and thus no information. Some messages may be likelier than others, and information implies surprise. Surprise is a way of talking about probabilities. If the letter following t (in English) is h, not so much information is conveyed, because the probability of h was relatively high.

Where a layman might have said that the fundamental problem of communication is to make oneself understood — to convey meaning — Shannon set the stage differently: The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. "Point" was a carefully chosen word: the origin and destination of a message could be separated in space or in time; information storage, as in a phonograph record, counts as a communication. Meanwhile, the message is not created; it is selected. ... (Shannon) could hardly overlook meaning altogether, ... dressed it with a scientist's definition ... : Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem.

如果要想在一个信道上传递更多信息，工程师通常的做法是，增大信源的输出功率。不过，这个方法在远距离通信中会失效，因为一次又一次地放大信号，只会导致噪声的逐渐积累。香农避免这个问题的办法是，把信号视为一串离散符号。这时，讯息发送者可以不通过增大信源的输出功率，而是通过使用额外的符号用于纠错，以此来克服噪声的干扰。这就像非洲的鼓手在进行远距离沟通时，他并不是更用力地去击鼓，而是为自己的言语增加额外的字词。

Every engineer, when asked to push more information through a channel, knew what to do: boost the power. Over long distances, however, this approach was failing, because amplifying a signal again and again leads to a crippling buildup of noise. Shannon sidestepped this problem by treating the signal as a string of discrete symbols. Now, instead of boosting the power, a sender can overcome noise by using extra symbols for error correction — just as an African drummer makes himself understood across long distances, not by banging the drums harder, but by expanding the verbosity of his discourse.

A stochastic process is neither deterministic (the next event can be calculated with certainty) nor random (the next event is totally free). It is governed by a set of probabilities.

... how much of a message influences the probability of the next symbol. The answer could be none: each symbol has its own probability but does not depend on what came before.

A message, as Shannon saw, can behave like a dynamical system whose future course is conditioned by its past history.
