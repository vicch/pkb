买羊肉的人和杀羊的人都是同伙。这是洁癖，不是道德：一个支持砍头，却「善良」得不能挥斧子砍头的人；或者一个认为战争无可避免，却因为不想杀人而逃避兵役的人。这是感情上的婴儿，伦理上的懦夫，左手肯定知道右手做的事，而你的心对双手都要负责。

The man who buys the meat is brother to the butcher. It was squeamishness, not morals - like the man who favors capital punishment but is himself too 'good' to fit the noose or swing the axe. Like the person who regards war as inevitable and in some circumstances moral, but who avoids military service because he doesn't like the thought of killing. Emotional infants, ethical morons - the left hand must know what the right hand doeth, and the heart is responsible for both.

「我们的外科医生可以在你身上设下机关，你被绑得再紧也可以想死就死。我要是把胳膊尽力往后弯，这动作只有通过有意识的努力才能做出来，我的肩胛骨之间有个小胶囊就会破掉，但是你在我背上捶打一整天也敲不破它。」

"Our surgeons can booby-trap you so that you can die at will in the tightest bonds anyone can put on you. For example, if I were to cramp my arms backward in a position a man never assumes without very considerable conscious effort, a little capsule between my shoulder blades would rupture and I would make my last report. Yet you could pound me on the back all day and never break it."

成功的革命是桩大买卖。在复杂而高度商业化的现代国家，革命不是一群人在废墟里围着淌泪的烛光密谋出来的。革命需要无数的人员、装备、现代化的机械和武器。要成功地操作这些要素，就必须保证忠诚、机密和绝佳的人员组织。

Successful revolution is Big Business - make no mistake about that. In a modern, complex, and highly industrialized state, revolution is not accomplished by a handful of conspirators whispering around a guttering candle in a deserted ruin. It requires countless personnel, supplies, modern machinery and modern weapons. And to handle these factors successfully there must be loyalty, secrecy, and superlative staff organization.

保密是一切暴政的要旨。不是暴力，而是保密，是审查。不论起初的动机如何神圣，如果任何政府、教会，开始对它的人民说，「这个你不能读，这个你不能看，这个禁止你了解」，其结果就是专制和压迫。控制一个思想被蒙蔽的人几乎不需要暴力；反之，任何暴力都不可能控制一个自由人。你无法征服一个自由人，你顶多只能杀死他。

I began to sense faintly that secrecy is the keystone of all tyranny. Not force, but secrecy ... censorship. When any government, or any church for that matter, undertakes to say to its subjects, 'This you may not read, this you must not see, this you are forbidden to know', the end result is tyranny and oppression, no matter how holy the motives. Mighty little force is needed to control a man whose mind has been hoodwinked; contrariwise, no amount of force can control a free man, a man whose mind is free. No, not the rack, not fission bombs, not anything-you can't conquer a free man; the most you can do is kill him.

「一个组合出来的人，根据伪造的记录和虚假背景细心打造出来的……比如说要转移一个流亡者，匆忙中又找不到与他匹配的真人，所以我们尽量保持多种类的合成人备用。」

「信息由两个信号词控制，如果没有听到这两个信号词，你不可能想起来的。一个检查员同时猜到这两个词及其排列顺序的几率可以忽略不计。不论清醒还是睡着，你都不可能泄露这个信息。」

"It's keyed to a pair of signal words; you can't possibly remember until they are spoken to you. The chance that an examiner would hit on both words and in the right order is negligible. You can't give the message away, awake or asleep."

「利用人自身的偏见――哪怕是在无关紧要的事情上的偏见――来左右一千个人，都比用逻辑说服一个人容易。一个词的内涵指数是个复杂变量函数，受到语境、听者年龄、性别、职业、所处地点和一大堆其他因素的影响。内涵指数让你知道针对某个特定听众或某一类听众，用某种特定方式说出某个词，会对他产生什么影响。如果能够准确测量受众，其数学精确性可以达到其他工程学分支的高度。」

"You can sway a thousand men by appealing to their prejudices quicker than you can convince one man by logic. It doesn't have to be a prejudice about an important matter either. The index of a word is a complex variable function depending on context, age and sex and occupation of the listener, the locale and a dozen other things. An index is a particular solution of the variable that tells you whether a particular word is used in a particular fashion to a particular reader or type of reader will affect that person favorably, unfavorably, or simply leave him cold. Given proper measurements of the group addressed it can be as mathematically exact as any branch of engineering."

「不让人有性行为，使性变得禁忌和邪恶，仅限于仪式性的繁殖，把性欲压制成为虐待欲，然后给人们一个替罪羊去仇恨，让他们偶尔杀一个替罪羊发泄和放松。这种手段太古老了，远在「心理学」这个词出现之前多少个世纪暴君们就在使用了。」

"Take sex away from people. Make it forbidden, evil, limit it to ritualistic breeding. Force it to back up into suppressed sadism. Then hand the people a scapegoat to hate. Let them kill a scapegoat occasionally for cathartic, release. The mechanism is ages old. Tyrants used it centuries before the word "psychology" was ever invented."

"My religious faith is a private matter between me and my God. I decline to explain them nor to justify them to you. I think that a man is obliged to lay down his life for his brothers, should it be required of him. But I don't propose to prove any of those things; they are beyond proof. And I don't demand that you believe as I do."

和革命相比，战争真是件简单的事。战争是一种应用科学，其原理清晰而历经考验。武器从投石器进化到了氢弹，战略却并无太大变化。革命却都是非正常状态，是一种畸形的突变，其条件绝不重复，行动执行者又都是业余人士和个人主义者。

War is a simple matter compared with revolution. War is an applied science, with well-defined principles tested in history; analogous solutions may be found from ballista to H-bomb. But every revolution is a freak, a mutant, a monstrosity, its conditions never to be repeated and its operations carried out by amateurs and individualists.

「就算一个人故意伤害了他人，政府也无意于做到的审判，或者予以惩罚。我们没有足够的智慧，而且这样的道德强制总会引发一系列不公正的后果，对所有人的自由造成威胁。对我们的生活方式你可以有自己的审美判断，也可以表达你的看法，但你不能期望我们为了符合你的口味而改变生活方式。你可以如你所愿地寻求危险和冒险，但是你不能随便让我们面对你的暴力倾向。」

"Even if one should willfully and knowingly damage another, the state does not attempt to sit in moral judgment, nor to punish. We have not the wisdom to do that, and the chain of injustices that have always followed such moralistic coercion endanger the liberty of all. You are free to hold and express your esthetic opinion of our way of living, but you must not expect us to live to suit your tastes. You are free to seek danger and adventure if you wish, but you are not free to expose us to the violence of your nature."

「我同意你对于这个人的感觉和判断，而且从个人角度来说，对你打了他一拳感到很高兴。但你的心理测量显示，你认为自己可以对与你同样的公民进行道德判断，并且有理由对他们的过失进行纠正与惩罚。你是个危险人物，因为我们无法预计你将会造成什么样的损害。」

"I agree with your esthetic judgment of that individual, and am personally rather gratified that you took a punch at him. But your psychometrical tests show that you believe yourself capable of judging morally your fellow citizens and feel justified in personally correcting and punishing their lapses. You are a dangerous individual, for we can not predict whet damage you may do next."

这辆钢制龟甲车让麦金纳感觉自己和鲁滨逊一样自由。他并没意识到自己的运载工具是成百上千人智力合作和不断努力的结果。过去他的天赋都表现在文学批评而非工程技术上，但他还是相信只靠他的天生智慧，加上基本参考书的帮助，他就能够在必要时再造出一辆龟甲车。他知道他需要金属矿石，但他并不觉得这是什么障碍，因为他不知道自己对于勘探、采矿和冶炼跟对驴子一样无知。

The steel tortoise gave MacKinnon a feeling of Crusoe-like independence. It did not occur to him his chattel was the end product of the cumulative effort and intelligent co-operation of hundreds of thousands of men, living and dead. His talents had been devoted in the past to literary criticism rather than engineering, but that did not prevent him from believing that his native intelligence and the aid of a few reference books would be all that he would really need to duplicate the tortoise, if necessary. Metal ores were necessary, he knew, but saw no obstacle in that, his knowledge of the difficulties of prospecting, mining, and metallurgy being as sketchy as his knowledge of burros.

"You broke his nose, yet he had done you no harm of any sort. He made a noise with his mouth - a verbal label. If the label does not fit you, the noise is meaningless. If the label is true in your case, you are neither more, nor less, that thing by reason of some one uttering the verbal label. In short, he did not damage you."

革命者们希望最大限度地保证个人自由。首先，他们抛弃了「公平」这个概念。从语义学上检视，「公平」没有任何指标，在连续的时间-空间-物质组合中没有任何能被观察到的现象，可以被指出来说：「这就是公平。」科学只能处理可以观察和测量的事物，「公平」不是这样的事物，它对于每个人的含义都不一样，关于它的任何「杂音」都会增加混乱。但是伤害，无论是身体上的还是经济上的，都可以指出并测量。

The revolutionists wished to establish maximum personal liberty. First they junked the concept of "justice". Examined semantically "justice" has no referent - there is no observable phenomenon in the space-time-matter continuum to which one can point, and say, "This is justice." Science can deal only with that which can be observed and measured. Justice is not such a matter; therefore it can never have the same meaning to one as to another; any "noises" said about it will only add to confusion. But damage, physical or economic, can be pointed to and measured.

「个人都是和善而正派的――在作为个体，对待其他个体时。伊芙的邻居和朋友对她没有威胁，我的邻居和朋友对我也没有。但我的邻居和朋友对她而言就是威胁，她的对我也一样。群体心理并不是简单的个人心理总和，这是社会群体行为规则，也就是暴民狂热定律。在表达它的数学公式产生前很久，军事、政治和宗教领袖，广告人、先知、煽动者、演员和黑帮领袖都利用过它。」

"Individuals are kind and decent - as individuals and to other individuals. Eve is in no danger from her neighbors and friends, and I am in no danger from mine. But she is in danger from my neighbors and friends, and I from hers. Mass psychology is not simply a summation of individual psychologies; that is a prime theorem of social psychodynamics. It is the social mass-action rule, the mob-hysteria law, known and used by military, political, and religious leaders, by advertising men and prophets and propagandists, by rabble rousers and actors and gang leaders, for generations before it was formulated in mathematical symbols."

"Life experience is linearly additive, but the correlation of memory impressions is an unlimited expansion. If mankind lived as long as a thousand years, it would be necessary to invent some totally different method of memory association in order to be eclectively time-binding.

The New Frontiers had no tanks; her converter accepted any mass at all, turned it into pure radiant energy. Anything would serve - meteors, cosmic dust, stray atoms gathered in by her sweep field, or anything from the ship herself, such as garbage, dead bodies, deck sweepings, anything at all. Mass was energy. In dying, each tortured gram gave up nine hundred million trillion ergs of thrust.

They were "seeing" now only by electronic vision. To the human eye itself the hemisphere behind them along their track was a vasty black; the shortest radiations had dopplered to wavelengths too long for the eye. In the forward direction stars could still be seen but their visible "light" was made up of longest Hertzian waves crowded in by the ship's incomprehensible speed. Dark "radio stars" shined at first magnitude; stars poor in radio wavelengths had faded to obscurity. The familiar constellations were changed beyond easy recognition.

Libby got that completely baffled look which mathematical-physicists wear whenever laymen try to talk about physics in nonmathematical language. "You're referring to the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction. But, if you'll pardon me, anything one says about it in words is necessarily nonsense. The formulae used to describe the effect loosely called a contraction presuppose that the observer is part of the phenomenon. But verbal language contains the implicit assumption that we can stand outside the whole business and watch what goes on. The mathematical language denies the very possibility of any such outside viewpoint. Every observer has his own world line; he can't get outside it for a detached viewpoint."
"There is no way to measure time in any absolute sense when two events are separated in a continuum. All you can measure is interval."

知识本身并不能赢得战争。欧洲中世纪那些无知的宗教狂人打败了成就远高于他们的伊斯兰文化；阿基米德被一个普通士兵打死；野蛮人洗劫了罗马。

Knowledge alone did not win wars. The ignorant fanatics of Europe's Middle Ages had defeated the incomparably higher Islamic culture; Archimedes had been struck down by a common soldier; barbarians had sacked Rome.

「衰老主要是代谢过程中有毒废物的积累，血液会把它们运走，但后来血液里毒素太多，清理过程就无法正常进行。」
「问题在于扩散压逆差。细胞在血液一面的扩散压力差必须能够维持一个很高的浓度梯度，否则细胞就会产生越来越严重的自体中毒。保证废物的正常清理从而抵挡死亡的基本观念早就有了，我手头有点鸡心组织，靠同样的技术已经活了两个半世纪。」

"Old age is primarily a matter of the progressive accumulation of the waste poisons of metabolism. The blood is supposed to carry them away, but presently the blood gets so clogged with the poisons that the scavenging process doesn't take place properly."
"It's a matter of diffusion pressure deficit - the d.p.d. on the blood side of a cell wall must be such as to maintain a fairly sharp gradient or there will occur progressive autointoxication of the individual cells. The basic idea of holding off death by insuring proper scavenging of waste products is not new - I have a bit of chicken heart which has been alive for two and one half centuries through equivalent techniques."

「人类，我们这样的人类，地球人，从来没有足够的时间去研究那些重要的问题。我们有很多能力，却没有足够的时间去正确使用。在那些重要的问题上，我们可能还只是猴子。不过我可以告诉你，不管答案是什么，只要树还没有倒下去，这只猴子就会一直往上爬，一直四处张望，去看所有它能看到的东西。」

"Men - our kind of men - Earth men - never have had enough time to tackle the important questions. Lots of capacity and not time enough to use it properly. When it came to the important questions we might as well have still been monkeys. But I can tell you this, whatever the answers are, here's one monkey that's going to keep on climbing, and looking around him to see what he can see, as long as the tree holds out."
