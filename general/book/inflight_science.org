** 飞行安全

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
一年中，平均 125,000,000 名乘客中只有一人丧生于空难。这比火车旅行要安全三倍。汽车事故，同等风险比率是 1 比 10,000,000，约是飞行危险度的 12 倍。比起在飞机上度过的 6 小时，你在上班场所的 6 小时所可能遭遇事故的风险要更大。

The risk of being killed in a plane crash in any particular year is 1 in 125 million passenger journeys. This makes it three times safer on any particular journey than travelling by train. The equivalent risk for a car is 1 in 10 million – twelve times as dangerous. You're more likely to have a fatal accident during six hours spent in the workplace than you are during six hours on a plane.

一架飞机从德国某个机场起飞，脱离跑道的时候有些困难，最终才可谓是「爬」上了天空。后来大家才意识到，之前这个城市举办了一场钱币展销会。这趟航班的很多乘客都是钱币商人，袋子里都塞满了新入手的硬币。这些未曾预料的些许增重累计在一起使得乘客重量明显高过预期。

The plane, taking off from a German airport, struggled to get away from the runway and only just managed to claw its way into the air. It later turned out that there was a coin fair on in the city, and many of the passengers were coin dealers with their pockets crammed with new acquisitions. All this unexpected spare change pushed the passengers' weight well above the expected average.

** X 射线

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
当普通光照射在行李箱这样的物体上时，光束中的光子被吸收，使它不能完全穿透物体。这是因为光子中的能量被那些构成行李箱的粒子吸收了。电子一旦吸收光子中的能量，就从低能级跳到高能级。不久之后，富余的能量又重新以新光子的形式被释放出来，电子失去能量后又回到低能级。我们不清楚光子会朝哪个方向被电子射出来，不过总有一些光子能被我们的眼睛捕捉到。正是因为有了这些被电子释放出来的光子，我们才能看见周围的物体。

When ordinary light hits an object like a suitcase that isn't transparent, the photons of light are absorbed. This happens because the energy in the photon is sucked up by one of the particles that make up the suitcase. Once the electron has absorbed the energy of the photon, it's as if it were teetering on top of a high wall. Before long, that extra energy shoots back out in the form of a new photon, and the electron drops back to having less energy. We don't know in which direction a particular photon will shoot off, but over time some will head towards your eyes. It's these photons, pumped out by the electrons in an object, that allow you to see it.

_X 射线中光子的能量远远大于普通光线中的光子，这使它能够迅速突破物体原子中的电子层，减少与电子的相互作用。这意味着 X 射线可以穿透许多能阻挡普通光线的物体。_ X 射线穿透物体时会破坏其中的分子，如果细胞中的 DNA 分子或是其他重要的化学物质被 X 射线损坏，会大大提高患癌症的风险。医用 X 射线通常都被控制在最小剂量，用于扫描行李的 X 射线的强度比大多数医用 X 射线要大得多。

Each photon in X-rays has a lot more energy than a photon of ordinary light, enabling it to smash past the electrons in an object's atoms with much less interaction. This means that X-rays can penetrate many substances that stop ordinary light dead. In the process of battering through matter, the X-rays can cause damage to the molecules. If DNA molecules, or other important chemicals in the cell, are damaged by the impact of X-rays, the changes can increase the chances of cancer forming. Medical X-rays have to be used with care, keeping doses to a minimum. Baggage X-ray machines are considerably more powerful than most medical X-rays.

在机场看到的巨大的扫描设备使用的都是宽幅 X 射线，其中某些 X 射线的穿透能力要比另一些强。由于使用两种强度不同的 X 射线，操作屏幕上会显示出两幅色彩不同的影像。因此，操作者能够分辨出植物、塑料或爆炸物之类的「软」物品，它们在屏幕上呈现出橘色，而那些较难穿透的物品则显示为绿色。

Those big scanners you now find in airports use a wide band of X-rays, some more powerful than others. This distinction between the two strengths of X-ray is used to produce different-coloured images on the operator's screen. This way the picture will distinguish between "soft" matter like plants, plastic or explosives – which are usually coloured orange by the scanner – and less penetrable matter, which will let only the more powerful X-rays through – typically coloured green.

** 嗅探器

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
嗅探器通过分辨气味来排查爆炸物。和许多物质一样，爆炸物容易挥发。爆炸物中的化学分子会在室温下挥发，飘浮在空气中。

A sniffer hunts down explosives by their smell. Like many substances, explosives are to some extent volatile. This means that some of the molecules making up the chemicals within the explosive evaporate at room temperature and waft into the air.

狗是所有先进技术中最古老的一项。在人类有意识地培育下，狗成为了一个具有特定功能的独特品种，它们是最早的能行使自动化功能的「工具」。 _自然界中本没有狗，它们是人类开发出来的「工具」。狗是我们祖先创造的最了不起的东西之一。_ 与狗相比，巨石阵简直不值一提。狗是一项石器时代的「技术」，比巨石阵早 35000 年，而且直到今天，它们还活跃在世界各地的机场中。

The dog is the oldest piece of highly developed technology still in active use. Dogs have been consciously moulded into distinct breeds with specific functions in mind. They were the first autonomous technology. The dog is not a natural animal. It's a human-made piece of technology. The dog is one of the most impressive things our early ancestors made. Forget Stonehenge – it's a toy by comparison. The dog is a piece of Stone Age technology, developed 35,000 years before Stonehenge, that is still going strong in airports around the world.

不难想象，最初是经历了怎样试探性的接触，我们的祖先才开始不再与狼为敌。也许是在某个寒冷的冬天，一只狼悄悄地靠近火堆取暖，突然，其他猎食者闯入人类的营地，它一跃而起，和人类并肩作战，作为奖励，它得到了一块肉。也许，从那一刻起，在自然选择的作用下，改变就开始了。

It's easy to imagine those first, tentative steps away from the wolf's role as enemy. Perhaps it was a cold winter, and a wolf crept close to a fire to keep warm. Maybe while it was there some other predator attacked the camp – the wolf, ever the pack animal, jumped to the defence of the humans, fighting alongside them. It was rewarded with a gift of meat.

** 金属探测器

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
金属探测拱门中有好几个线圈。线圈中的电流能使附近金属物体的周围产生磁场，而这个磁场反过来又会使检测线圈中产生感应电流。

In the arch of a metal detector, there will be several coils of wire. The flow of electricity in these generates a magnetic field, which produces electric currents in any metal objects nearby. These currents generate magnetism in their turn, which finally produces electricity in a detection coil.

** 人体扫描仪

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
人体扫描仪可分为两大类，它们使用的都是不可见光。有些使用高能量（波长短）波，有些则为 X 射线。高能量波扫描仪的波长频率与微波类似，没有证据显示该波会造成健康隐患。人体扫描仪采用的是一种称为反向散射 X 射线的流程。在扫描时，X 射线不会穿透你的身体，它穿透你的衣服却被你的身体反弹回来，到达环绕在你四周的探测器。这些 X 射线的辐射量极其小，相当于人们日常生活中每小时所遭受的辐射的五十分之一。

There are two types of body scanners, both using non-visible forms of light. Some employ high-energy (short-wavelength) radio, while others use a form of X-ray. The radio version uses a frequency that is quite close to microwaves. There's no known evidence of a health risk from these radio signals. Full body scanners use a process called backscatter X-ray. Here, instead of passing through you, the X-rays pass through your clothes but are bounced back from your body to detectors all around you. These are very low-dose X-rays. You will be exposed to around 50 times as much damaging radiation for each hour you are in the air as you will receive from a backscatter scan.

** 生物识别

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
尽管从理论上来看，你身体的任何一个部位都可以用作生物数据辨识（如耳朵的大小），但在实际操作中，多数系统都会涉及面部、指纹和虹膜识别技术中的一项或几项。面部识别是最理想的，因为它可以进行远距离识别，并不需要受检者在监测点停下来按指纹或接受虹膜成像。对于安检来说，它是最实用不过了，每当乘客们停下来与工作人员交谈时，它便开始工作，而乘客们却毫无察觉。

Although in principle any aspect of your body could be used for biometrics (ear size, for instance), in practice most systems use one or more of face recognition, fingerprint recognition and iris recognition. Face recognition is the ideal technology, because it can be undertaken remotely without the individual having to stop at a booth to give a fingerprint or an iris photograph. More practically for security, it can be performed unobtrusively in the background at any point an individual stops to speak to an official.

** 随机事件

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
_迷信的根源在于人类对于事物偶发性的认知，而我们的大脑结构不擅长处理概率。_ 每天在各处发生的随机事件不计其数，大到传染病的爆发，小到有人跌倒。 _这些随机事件的分布如何？我们本能上以为它们是均匀分布的。_ 试想你将一小罐钢珠打翻在光滑平整的地面上。当钢珠静止时，若发现它们均匀地分布在地面上，彼此之间距离相等时，你会作何感想呢？ 自然状态下钢珠的分布是：某些区域小钢珠分布会密集些，而某些区域则会稀疏些。这样的分布便称之为群聚。 _群聚现象适用于现实世界任何事件的无序分布。_

The science of superstition is very much tied in with our perception of chance. Our brains just aren't wired well to cope with probability. Imagine something that happens randomly across the country, anything from outbreaks of disease to people falling over. How would you expect those random things to be distributed? Our natural response is to expect them to be spread out evenly. Imagine tipping a tin of ball bearings onto a flat, empty floor. What would you think if, when the balls stopped moving, they were evenly distributed in a grid, each the same space from the other? The natural thing is for there to be places where there are clumps of ball bearings and others where there are gaps. These clumps are known as clusters. Exactly the same thing happens with any randomly distributed event.

非传染性疾病的群发往往归咎于手机信号发射塔或是核电站（附近很有可能也有酒吧和教堂，但是他们却很少会成为替罪羊）。人们总是倾向于在身边找原因，尤其是当周围有某些引起人们焦虑的因素时，那么，它们则最容易成为替罪羊。得通过有效的统计手段来验证两者的因果关系，才能下定论。

Clusters of non-transmitted illnesses are often blamed on phone masts or nuclear power stations. It's very natural to look for a local cause, and, where there's a source of concern nearby, to assume that it's responsible. There are very effective statistical techniques to check on causality that need to be applied before jumping to conclusions.

** 航空燃料

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
航空燃料是煤油的一种，较之汽车使用的汽油或柴油，航空燃料的分子更大，也更不易挥发。假设我们正在使用高技术含量的电脑电池，将近 1 吨这样的电池才能释放出和 10 千克航空燃料等值的热量。这也是为什么我们在短时间内不会看到有充电飞机。航空燃料极好地压缩了能量，它每千克产生的能量是等量三硝基甲苯（TNT）爆炸时的 15 倍。

Aviation fuel is a form of kerosene (paraffin). Aircraft fuel typically has larger molecules than the petrol or diesel used for cars, and because of this is less volatile. Assuming we're using hi-tech computer batteries, to carry the same amount of energy as 10 kilograms of aviation fuel you need around a tonne of batteries. This is why you aren't going to see electric airliners any time soon. Aviation fuel crams the energy in so well that it has fifteen times the energy per kilogram of the explosive TNT.

氢气本身并不能成为一种能源，因为在你使用它之前，必须得先把它制造出来。不过，氢能提供一种优于石油的能源转换途径，因为当它燃烧时，唯一的排放物只有水蒸气。

Hydrogen isn't an energy source in its own right, because you have to make it before you can use it. But it's an alternative way of transporting energy, which has the advantage over fuel oil that when it burns, the only emission is water vapour.

碳非常容易与其他元素结合，组成长链条的分子。没有碳的这一性质，就没有蛋白质、DNA 和其他复杂的分子，而正是它们让生命的诞生有了可能。

Carbon is very good at combining with other elements to make long chains of molecules. Without that it would be impossible to build the proteins, DNA and other complex molecules that make life possible.

** 温室效应

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
大部分太阳的辐射都能到达地面，地表在接受了太阳能以后，以红外线的形式再向外辐射，红外线的能量低于来自太阳的可见光，向外辐射的能量一部分会被大气层中的二氧化碳分子吸收。几乎是在同时，二氧化碳分子重新释放出能量。这其中的一部分能量会回到宇宙中去，而剩下的则全部返回地面，使地表温度升高。如果离开了温室效应，地球上的平均气温很可能会跌至零下 18 摄氏度，比当前的实际气温低了 30 多度。

Most incoming sunlight shoots straight through greenhouse gases, but when the energy is re-emitted by the Earth as infra-red, which is lower-energy than the visible light that comes in from the Sun, some of it is absorbed by the CO2 molecules in the atmosphere. Almost immediately the molecules release the energy again. A portion continues into space, but the rest returns to Earth, warming the surface. Without greenhouse effect, the average temperature on the Earth would be -18 degree, over 30 degrees lower than it actually is.

地球上的主要热量都来自于太阳，越接近山顶的地方离太阳越近，所以，你也许会想山顶上应该更热才对。的确，山顶上的太阳射线最强，为什么山顶那么冷呢？这一切都是温室效应造成的。

The vast majority of the Earth's heat comes from the Sun, and the higher up a mountain you are, the closer you are to the Sun, so you might expect it to get warmer. There's certainly no doubt that the Sun's rays are strong on top of a mountain. So why is it so chilly up there? It's down to the greenhouse effect.

山脉能增加当地降雨，这些季节性的降雨会与空气中的二氧化碳发生反应。水和二氧化碳形成的酸性物质渗透地底，溶解岩石表面，置换出二氧化碳中的某些物质，形成稳定的碳化合物，但是它们不再回到大气中去。这个过程与全球变暖刚好相反，在它的作用下气温下降了。喜马拉雅山脉的形成引发了一系列使地球改头换面的冰川期。

The intrusion of the mountains increased rainfall in the area, and these monsoon rains reacted with the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The acid formed by carbon dioxide and water dissolved the surface of the rock below, forming stable carbonate compounds that locked in the carbon dioxide, preventing it from returning to the atmosphere. In a reverse of our current problem of global warming, the temperatures began to drop. The formation of the Himalayas triggered a series of ice ages that transformed the world.

金星就是一个温室效应泛滥的星球，大气层中二氧化碳的含量高达 97%。在这里，平均气温为 480 摄氏度，最高气温可以升至 600 摄氏度，这使金星成为太阳系中最热的星球。

An example of an out-of-control greenhouse effect is the planet Venus, with a 97 percent carbon dioxide atmosphere. Here average temperatures are 480 degree Celsius, with peaks of 600 degree, making it the hottest planet in the solar system.

** 碳排放

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
在所有出行工具中，飞机的碳排放量最大。拿一趟从欧洲至美国的长途飞行来说，每位乘客将排放 2.5 吨左右的二氧化碳，这相当于一辆普通汽车行驶 15000 千米所产生的碳排放量。当飞机还没上天之前，靠发动机来推动飞机似乎有些浪费而且效率也不高，尤其是在掉头时。所以，在飞机驶离航站楼时，需要飞机拖车（有时也叫牵引拖车）来帮忙。

Flying is the worst means of transport for carbon dioxide emissions. A typical long-haul flight from Europe to the US will produce around 2.5 tonnes of CO2 per passenger. That's the equivalent of driving around 15,000 kilometres in an average car. Manoeuvring driven by the aircraft engines is not a very efficient way to travel when the plane isn't in the air, particularly in reverse, so to get away from the terminal an aircraft tug (sometimes called a pushback tractor) is usually brought in.

飞机上也有一个雷达系统，安装在机头内，以预警前方的暴风雨。

Plane itself will have a radar system, built into the nose, that it uses to warn of storms ahead.

第一项能于肉眼之外发现飞机的可操作的技术是由英国人在第二次世界大战前夕研发出来的。雷达最初在英国投入使用时，民间流传起这样的说法，多吃胡萝卜能提高视力，尤其是夜间的视力。其实，这是英国空军策划的一次成功的宣传，到处放出消息说空军飞行员正在接受含有大量胡萝卜的饮食以提高其视力，因而能准确地发现入侵的德军轰炸机。

The first practical technology for spotting planes beyond the limits of visibility was developed in Britain just before the Second World War. The early British work with radar seems to have been the source of the old story that eating carrots improves your eyesight, especially in the dark. This was a piece of surprisingly successful propaganda put out by the Air Ministry during the war, who claimed that fighter pilots were on a diet that was rich in carrots to improve their night-time eyesight so that they could spot incoming German bombers.

雷达既是光源，同时也是接收器，它释放出成束的光子，然后感应由物体反射回来的光子。 _由于能量低于可见光，光子很难描绘出物体的具体特征，通常都只能模糊地显示轮廓，_ 远没有人眼看到的景象那样复杂而详尽。

Radar is both the source and the detector. It emits a stream of photons, then looks out for the re-emitted photons coming back from an object. Because the photons have lower energy than visible light they are less able to detect specific features, so typically just show a blob, rather than the detailed view we get with eyesight.

** 无线电

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
有些无线电是不需要人工操作的。导航灯塔就是这样的全自动的无线电波发射器，它不断地发射出信号，告知飞机何时转向。VOR，即甚高频全向信标，一架飞机一般会用到两台这样的装置来确认自己的位置。

Some of the radio use is automated. Navigation beacons are unmanned radio transmitters that send out a continuous stream of information to enable planes to know where to turn on flight paths. VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Radio Range), a plane typically uses two of these beacons to get a fix on location.

机场内有些自动无线电发射装置更加精密，能提供 ILS（仪表着陆系统）装置，可以精确定位跑道，提供飞机接近地面时的准确角度。有了 ILS 提供的信息，外加一些特殊雷达装置，一架装备精良的飞机能在可见度为零的情况下自动降落，无需飞行员手动操作，这样的系统被称为自动着陆系统。

A more sophisticated collection of automated radio transmitters at airports provide ILS (Instrument Landing System) facilities, which pinpoint the line of the runway and the angle at which the plane is approaching the ground. By combining ILS information with special radar facilities, a suitably equipped plane can land in zero visibility without the pilot handling the controls, a system known as autoland.
#+END_QUOTE

** TCAS

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
大部分飞机上都装有飞行警报和防撞机系统（TCAS）。TCAS 会向其他也装配了相同系统的飞机发出信号来获得它们的位置。每架飞机都配备了一种叫做发射机应答器的装置，这是一种能发出无线电信号的全自动的信号发射器。因此，当发射器接收到其他飞机的请求时，应答器就自动开始工作，向对方播报自己的位置。这样一来，对方飞机就能知道附近有哪些飞机以及它们的位置了。

Airliners are usually equipped with a traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS). The TCAS equipment sends out requests for information to other aircraft fitted with the same technology. Each aircraft has built into it a device called a transponder. This is a radio-activated automatic radio transmitter. So when it gets a request from another aircraft, the transponder springs into life, broadcasting its location. That way the other aircraft can build up a picture of the positions of any other aircraft around.

** GPS

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
GPS 利用附近的 24～30 颗卫星来判断地球上任何一个 GPS 接收器所处的位置，这些卫星运行在高度 2 万公里的轨道上。越来越多的卫星被送上天，让系统更加精确，所以卫星的数量一直在增加。 _每颗卫星都携带着一只走时精准的计时器，并且不断地播报时间和卫星轨道的位置。每只接收器通常需要 4～6 颗卫星的信号，以光速为单位，计算信号从卫星到达接收器所需的时间，来确认自己的方位。_

GPS uses the nearest handful from a collection of between 24 and 30 satellites scattered around the globe at an altitude of 20,000 kilometres (12,500 miles) to pinpoint the location of a GPS receiver anywhere on the Earth. More satellites are being added to make the system more accurate, so the number is increasing. Each satellite carries a very accurate clock and constantly broadcasts the time and the satellite's orbital position. The GPS receiver typically latches onto between four and six of these transmissions and uses them to fix its location based on knowledge of how long the signals from the satellite should take to arrive at the speed of light.

狭义相对论提出，快速走动的钟表会比我们期望的走得慢些，并预测到，和地球上的时钟相比，GPS 卫星上的计时器每天差不多晚点 700 万分之一秒，广义相对论告诉我们，重力也会导致时钟变慢。卫星所承受的重力牵引要比我们在地球表面上的小得多，因此，卫星上的计时器每天将多走 4500 万分之一秒。卫星导航系统正是依靠着极其精准的测量来获得准确定位的。 _如果没有相对论指导纠正偏差，仅仅一天之内，GPS 所提供的方位将可能偏差好几公里。_

Special relativity says that fast-moving clocks will run slower than you would expect them to, and predicts that the clocks on GPS satellites will lose around 7 millionths of a second every day compared with clocks on Earth. General relativity tells us that gravity also has the effect of slowing clocks down. As the satellites experience a weaker gravitational pull than we do on the Earth's surface, their clocks should gain around 45 millionths of a second a day. Satellite navigation is dependent on very accurate measurements to get the position right. In just a day, without correcting for relativity, the position provided by GPS would be wrong by several kilometres.

** INS

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
决定物体惯性的是它的质量，而不是它的重量。物体的质量是其与生俱来的一种属性，无论处于地球表面，还是月球表面，或是飘浮于宇宙中，它的质量不变。 _物体的质量决定它受力时的加速度。重量代表了引力对物体的影响。_ 在地球上物体的重量等于它的质量。这个现象反映了质量的单位的本质，在地球引力下，重量和质量是等值的，但是度量单位不同。

Inertia depends on an object's mass, rather than its weight. An object's mass is an inherent property of that object, something that will be the same whether you're standing on the surface of the Earth, standing on the surface of the Moon, or floating in space. Mass describes how much force it takes to give that object a certain amount of acceleration. Weight reflects the effect of gravity. An object's mass on Earth is the same as its weight. This reflects the way the units of mass were defined, so they come out the same on Earth, as that's where we tend to weigh things.

惯性制导系统（INS）会通过 GPS 确认飞机当前的位置和速度。然后测出飞机加速和减速，以及角加速度（旋转加速度），这些数据能帮助人们追踪飞机从初始点开始的方位。INS 的优点在于即便在无线电通讯中断，飞机无法和 GPS 或导航信标取得联络的情况下，它也能测量出飞机的运动参数。在通讯中断时，INS 能够不间断地标示出飞机准确的位置。

An INS (Inertial Navigation System) starts by establishing a current position and speed, typically from GPS. It then measures the rate at which the plane is accelerating and decelerating, plus any angular acceleration (turning acceleration), to be able to keep tracking the location of the plane from its initial point. The advantage of doing this is that these measurements can be made even if radio communication is unavailable, leaving the plane isolated from GPS and navigation beacons. The INS will continue to plot the location with considerable accuracy despite any communication problems.

** 陀螺仪

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
陀螺仪测量角运动参数。陀螺仪转子的转速极其之快，获得巨大的角动量。陀螺仪一旦开始旋转，基于角动量守恒的理论，它能反抗任何改变转子轴向的力量。飞机上的陀螺装置的底座固连在飞机上，转子轴提供惯性空间的给定方向。则当飞机转弯时，仪表就相对转子轴转动，从而能给出转弯的角度和航向的指示。

A gyroscope is used to measuring the amount of acceleration in twists and turns. The disc of gyroscope has a large amount of angular momentum because of spinning extremely quickly, it resists any attempt to change its orientation, because that would change the angular momentum. So when the disc is mounted in gimbals that allow it to swing freely in three dimensions, as you twist and turn the object the gimbals are attached to - an aircraft in our case - the disc will keep in its original orientation as the plane moves around it. By measuring how the orientation of the disc changes, you can monitor the twisting acceleration and keep track of the plane's flight path.

** 电波干扰

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
比起 40 年前的飞机来说，现在的飞机对敏感的电子设备依赖程度更高。从理论上来说，手机发出的信号，或是笔记本电脑这类设备造成的电波干扰的确会影响到飞机上那些电子设备的正常工作。不过就像加油站禁止使用手机这样的规定一样，并没有充分的案例显示这么做一定会发生危险。

The problem is that modern planes are highly dependent on sensitive electronics, much more so than aircraft of 40 years ago. In principle, the radio signal from a phone, or the radio interference caused by other electronic devices like laptops, could interfere with these electronics, though like the ban on mobile phones in filling stations, there's very little evidence of danger.

所有商业性空中交通的交流语言都是英语。即便双方一个是中国的地面操控员，一个是中国的班机。小型飞机是通过其注册编号认定身份的，与之不同的是商业飞机，其用于无线电联络的呼号是由航空公司代号加上飞机编号的数字部分组成的。

All commercial air traffic communication is undertaken in English – even if it involves, for example, a Chinese controller handling a Chinese flight. Unlike light aircraft, which are indentified by the registration number of the plane, a commercial airliner will be referred to on the radio by a combination of a designator for the airline plus the numerical part of the flight number.

** 跑道

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
一个大型的国际机场跑道的长度有 3～5 千米。大型机场一般会有多条平行的跑道和一些面朝不同方向的二级跑道，以提高机场的吞吐量。这是因为，飞机的起飞和降落都需要逆风进行。在现实情况下，机场跑道不可能顾及各个方位，所以它们的方向通常与当地盛行风的方向一致。

At a major international airport, the runways can be 3 to 5 kilometres long. Big airports often have parallel runways to increase throughput, with additional secondary runways positioned at different angles. This is because aircraft take-offs and landings are best made facing into the wind. Realistically, you can't have runways facing in all directions, so airports typically go for the prevailing wind direction.

每条跑道都以它们的磁方位角的缩写编号（在跑道的尽头你能看见巨大的数字）。如果某条跑道与磁北顺时针方向的夹角为 10 度以内，那它就被编为 01 号。夹角若为 20 度以内则为 02 号跑道，以此类推。由于飞机有可能从跑道任何一端着陆，所以跑道的两端都被编了号，两个数字相减为 18。

The runways are labelled (you'll see a large number painted on the end of the runway) with a contraction of their compass direction. If the direction of the runway is within the first ten degrees to the east of north, it's designated 01. The next ten degrees is 02 and so on. As planes may have to approach the runway from either direction, the two ends of the runway will be labelled with numbers that differ by 18.

大部分时候，你都不得不在跑道的起点等上几分钟，让前面的飞机先冲上跑道，这样后面的飞机就能远离它们喷射出的气流，尤其是当前面的飞机比你那架飞机要大的时候。 _飞机翼尖产生的涡流需要 2～3 分钟才能平复。_ 若是有飞机驶入混乱的气流，它将变得难以操控，因此，飞机起飞需要间隔，留出足够的时间让气流恢复稳定。

There's a fair chance that you will have to wait in place for a number of minutes, until the plane ahead has started down the runway, so you don't get hit by its jet blast, particularly if the aircraft in front is bigger than yours. The vortices produced by the wingtips of a plane can take 2 to 3 minutes to subside. If another plane flies into the disrupted air it can become difficult to handle, so the gap between take-offs allows enough time for the air to settle down.

发动机熄火时，你能看见其前部的巨大的风叶，它们吸入并压缩空气。空气将与雾状燃料混合在一起，这些混合物会在燃烧室里被点燃。这将产生巨大的能量，部分能量将输送给涡轮机以保持压缩机叶片持续运转，但绝大多数能量将从引擎后部喷射出去，汇入压缩机叶片吸入的强劲的空气中。由于引擎对空气产生了一个巨大的向后推力，反过来，空气也会以相同的力量将发动机（飞机）推向前。飞机之所以能持续飞行，靠的就是牛顿第三定律。

The big fan you can see at the front of a stopped engine sucks in air and compresses it. The air then gets mixed up with a mist of fuel and the combination is ignited in a combustion chamber. This produces a blast of energy, part of which powers a turbine to keep the compressor blades going, but most of which shoots out of the rear of the engine, joining the powerful flow of air sucked through by the compressor blades. Because the engine gives the air a huge push backwards, in its turn that air gives the engine (and hence the plane) the same amount of thrust forwards. The only thing that keeps the plane moving is Newton's third law.

** 起飞

飞行员会依次接到指令让飞机加速到 V1，VR 和 V2，这是至关重要的三个空速。对于每一个型号的飞机来说，这三个速度都相对固定。飞机一旦接到 V1 的指令，就意味着它必须起飞，V1 被称为决断速度。VR 中的 R 代表 rotation，当飞机达到这个速度时，飞行员会接到 Rotate（抬轮）的指令。飞行员向后轻拉操纵杆，变换水平尾翼舵面的角度，让机头抬头离地。这样的倾斜能使空气与机翼之间形成更小的角度，使飞机获得更多升力。此时，飞机虽然还没有完全离开地面，却一直处于加速中，当加速到 V2（起飞速度）时，它就成功起飞了。

As the plane accelerates, the pilot will be told as the plane passes 3 critical air speeds, known as V1, VR and V2. Each of these speeds is fixed for a particular aircraft. V1 is, in effect, the speed of no return. When the first officer calls out "V1" the plane is committed to take-off. The "R" in VR stands for "rotation", and at this point the first officer calls out "Rotate". The pilot pulls back gently on the control stick, changing the angle of the tailplane control surface so that the aircraft rotates on its main undercarriage, lifting the nose wheel off the ground. This tilt means that the air is hitting the wings at a sharper angle, giving more lift. The plane is still accelerating on the ground until V2 is reached, the take-off speed.

机舱中的压力低于标准大气压，由此产生耳朵不适的症状。一架民用飞机的巡航高度为 35000～40000 英尺（约为 5 英里或 11 千米）。之所以选择在这个高度上飞行，一方面是为了省油，因为这个高度上的空气阻力较小；另一方面是为了避开影响飞行安全的气流。在这个高度上，气压极低，使人无法呼吸，这里的氧气量只有地面上的 1/4，所以，此时机舱内需要加压。

This ear popping is caused by the air pressure in the cabin of the aircraft reducing to a level below standard atmospheric pressure. A commercial airliner cruises at between 35,000 and 40,000 feet (around 7 miles or 11 kilometres). This is partly to save on fuel because of the reduced air resistance, and partly to be well above most of the weather systems that can make a flight uncomfortable. At that level, the air pressure outside is too low to be breathable, with around a quarter as much oxygen as you'd get on the ground, so the cabin is pressurized.

从理论上来讲，人们可以将机舱中的压力调整至与海平面气压一致，但是 _随着压力增大，飞机的重量也会随之增加，以确保机舱处于密封状态，因此需要在两者间找到一种平衡。人们认为海平面上 6000～8000 英尺的气压是机舱内最合适的气压，这个高度类似于墨西哥城的海拔，它是地球上海拔最高的城市。6000 英尺处的气压相当于海平面气压的 80%，这意味着你只能获得平时 4/5 的氧气量。而 8000 英尺高空的气压只有平时的 3/4。_

In principle the cabin could have the same pressure as you would have at sea level, but the greater the pressure, the heavier the plane has to be to stay airtight. There's a trade-off. It was arbitrarily decided that a reasonable cabin pressure was the equivalent of being at between 6,000 and 8,000 feet above sea level, reflecting the altitude of the highest cities on Earth like Mexico City. The pressure at 6,000 feet is around 80 percent that at sea level, meaning you get around four fifths as much oxygen as usual. At 8,000 feet you're down to around 75 percent normal pressure.

In practice the doors on a plane don't need to be locked. Once the plane has taken off, a significant pressure difference soon builds up between the inside of the plane and the outside, as the cabin pressure becomes higher than the rapidly falling outside pressure.

你也许听过这样的说法，机翼的形状很特别，空气从机翼上方通过的距离要大于从下方通过的距离。按照这个假设，为了追赶上下方的空气分子，上方的空气分子会加快运动速度，这样两者才能同时在机翼前端汇合，这样一来，机翼上方的空气就变稀薄了。由于空气变少，它在机翼上方产生的压力就会减少。这意味着，机翼获得了向上的升力。没有理由说，机翼上方的空气分子就一定要追赶上下方的空气分子。而事实是，通过机翼上方空气的速度远远超出了那个需要追赶的速度，导致该现象的原因也和机翼上下两面的长度没有任何关系。真正的原因是流体（空气）复杂的运动方式。

You may have heard that wings have a special shape whereby the length of the journey that the air travels over the top of the wing is greater than the distance along the bottom. As the air has further to go along the top, the argument goes, these air molecules will travel faster to keep up with the air going around the bottom, which thins out the air across the top of the wing. And with less air at any particular point, the pressure on the top surface drops. That means the wing should feel a force upwards. There's no particular reason why air going over the top would try to catch up with air going around the bottom. As it happens, the speed that air goes over the top of a typical wing shape is much faster than the speed necessary to catch up with air going around the bottom. This effect is completely unrelated to the different distances along the top and bottom of the aerofoil. Instead it's down to the complex way a fluid like air moves.

Acceleration is actually a change in velocity, not a change in speed. The difference between speed and velocity is that velocity has both speed and direction. It's what's known as a vector.

This means the air is accelerating, and as it curves down over the wing, that acceleration is downwards. A force is being applied downwards on the air by the wing, and the air exerts an equal and opposite force up on the wing.

Extensions on the inner trailing edge of the wing retract soon after take-off – and you will certainly see them extend before landing. These are flaps. Flaps have a dual effect on the wing. By increasing the area of the wing, they push up the amount of upward thrust. This means that the plane can fly stably at a lower speed. The flaps also increase drag. This is a backwards force that slows the plane down. If the flaps were used in take-off they will soon be withdrawn to minimize drag.

Different parts of the stream don't have to move together, as they do in a solid object. The faster movement on the inner bank is down to the conservation of angular momentum. Angular momentum depends on the distance a mass is from the centre of spin and the velocity with which it's moving. Such angular momentum is conserved, it stays the same unless you apply a force. When the skater's arms come in, the radius is reduced, so the velocity needs to increase to keep the angular momentum the same.

由于地表凹凸不平，当溪流形成时，它们不会笔直地朝一个方向流去。当水流流经半径较小的左边的内侧河道时，其流动的速度会加快以保持角动量守恒。这样一来， _外侧河岸所受的压力将略高于内侧河岸。不同的压力造成了河水从河岸外侧至内侧的二次流动，并从外侧河岸带来沉积物。因此，泥沙从弯道的外侧被冲刷到了内侧，这使得河道愈来愈弯曲。_ 最后河水流成了一条潦草的正弦曲线。

Because of variances in the lie of the land, when a stream forms it's unlikely to be dead straight. When the water is going around the smaller radius of the inner bank, it will speed up to preserve angular momentum. One of the results of this is a slightly higher water pressure on the outer bank than on the inner. This difference in pressure causes a secondary flow to occur, from the outer bank towards the inner, pulling with it material from the outer bank. So soil moves from the outer bank of the curve to the inner bank. This makes the curvature of the bend greater. The result is a meandering route.

As you measure to more and more detail, so the length can be increased indefinitely. In principle, mathematically at least, the coastline could end up being infinitely long. Koch curve covers a finite area, it will never come out of the circle, but the distance around the edge of the Koch curve can carry on growing as you continue to add triangles until it's infinite in length.

** 海水

海水本身并不含盐，它的成分包括钠离子和氯离子，海水中的钠离子来自于如硅酸钠之类的岩石和碳酸钠。河流入海的旅途中，沿途的碳酸钠溶解于河水中，被带入海洋。海水拍打岸边那些含钠的礁石，也会将钠带入海洋。海水中的氯离子大多来自海底火山和排气孔洞，它们向海水中喷射大量的化学物质。

Sea water doesn't contain salt. What it actually contains are sodium ions and chlorine ions. The sodium ions in the sea have got there as a result of rock material like sodium silicate and sodium carbonate dissolving on a river's journey to the sea, or as sea water passes over and smashes into appropriate rocks. The chlorine ions in the sea have mostly come from underwater volcanoes and vents, which churn out vast quantities of chemicals into the sea.

In ordinary sea water, the two sets of ions, sodium and chlorine, are floating around, no more associated with each other than any of the many other ions the sea contains. But if you evaporate sea water, the concentration of the ions increases, the positive sodium is attracted to the negative chlorine and the two join together, forming crystals of sodium chloride or common salt.

地球上面向月球的海水暴涨，朝天空中月亮的方向掀起高涌的潮头。而地球的另一侧，由于离月亮较远，海水受到月球的引力相对微弱，产生离心的趋势，因此在背向月球的海面也形成隆起的潮头。这些潮汐追随着天空中月亮的位置，横扫整个地球表面。

The sea water on the Moon-facing side of the Earth bulges up skyward. As the gravitational pull of the Moon on the far side of the Earth is weaker, the water is less attracted in the Moon's direction, and bulges out away from it. The result is that two high tides are in progress at any one time, one on the side of our planet facing the Moon, the other on the side furthest away from it. These tides sweep around the Earth, following the position of the Moon in the sky.

Initially we were limited to three or four miles per hour on foot, then gained the capabilities of a horse or crude boat. With the 19th century, speeds of at least 50mph (80km/h) became commonplace thanks to the train.

The maximum possible speed in the 20th century was when travelling on Concorde, reaching a remarkable 1,350mph (2,170km/h), twice the speed of sound. Sometimes technological achievements reach a plateau, at least for a time. Concorde's rapid trip from having hundreds of orders to being practically given away shows that the real speed limit is not so much technology as political will.

虽然阳光涵盖了光谱中所有的色彩，但是其中黄色光的比重最大。太阳表面 5500 摄氏度左右的高温导致了它现有的颜色。阳光中不同的光子释放出不同的能量，当它们混合在一起穿过空气时，一些光子被空气分子中的电子吸收。很快，它们又被重新释放，朝各个方向发射出去。这样的「散射」意味着通过空气的光线会有一部分偏离原来的运动方向而离开了原来的光束，它们的光子在空中四处扩散。能量较高的光子（光谱中位于蓝色末端）更容易发生散射。这意味着，除了太阳本身之外，经过空气分子散射后的光线都呈现出蓝色，所以天空就变成蓝的了。光谱中位于红色末端的光线散射能力较弱，夕阳西下时，由于斜照，光得经过很厚的大气层才能到达地球，这些红色的光线因为不像蓝光一样易于散射而损失最小，因此天空便被染成了红色。

The yellow component of the light the Sun gives out is the strongest, but it does provide the whole spectrum of light. The natural colour of the Sun reflects its surface temperature of around 5,500°C. When this light containing a mix of photons with different energies passes through the air, some of the photons that make up the light get absorbed by the electrons in the gas molecules of the air. Soon after they are re-emitted and shoot off, but in all directions. This "scattering" means that photons are flung across the sky, no longer all on the same path. Higher-energy photons (towards the blue end of the colour spectrum) are more likely to be scattered. This means that away from the Sun itself, the light being scattered from the air molecules has a blue tinge, making the sky blue. Because the red end of the spectrum is scattered less, when sunlight is passing through a lot of air, which happens when the Sun is low in the sky, the light that isn't scattered, coming direct from the Sun, takes on a red tinge.

This process of getting through a barrier like a wall and appearing on the other side is called quantum mechanical tunnelling. Mostly the hydrogen nuclei in the Sun stay roughly where you would expect them to be, but occasionally one will tunnel through the barrier caused by the repulsion that keeps them away from other nuclei, and will appear so near a neighbour that fusion takes place. Although this is very unlikely for any particular hydrogen nucleus, there are so many of them in the Sun that statistically a vast number will succeed, resulting in a steady transformation of hydrogen into helium.

Air is quite a good insulator, but if you crank up the voltage of the electricity, you will eventually get a spark to break down the resistance and jump through the air.

To make a metre-long electrical discharge under normal circumstances would take around 3 million volts.

在带负电荷的雷雨云团和由其产生的正电荷的相互作用下，例如，云团和地面之间，另一种能量相对较小的放电发生了。空气在这种放电作用下发生电离。电离过程中原子中的外层电子摆脱原子核的束缚而脱离，原子成为带正电荷传导性更强的离子。 _第一次击闪开辟出了闪电通道，因此被称为先导。接下来，云中出现一根闪亮无比、携带巨大电流的光柱，这被称为回击。回击与第一次击闪的方向相反——第一次击闪中闪电由云层击向地面，而在回击发生时，电流则从地面驰向云底，和人们预想的方向相反。_

A relatively weak electrical discharge runs between the negatively-charged storm cloud and the positive charge it has induced, say from the cloud down to Earth. This discharge ionizes the air. Ionization means it strips electrons off atoms, leaving the very atoms of the air charged and making it more conductive. This first stroke, called a leader, has set up a pathway. Now the main discharge, the one we see, called the return stroke, takes place. This goes in the opposite direction, if the lightning is striking the Earth, the return stroke runs from the ground up to the cloud, the opposite direction to the one we would expect.

闪电电击有着超高的电压，而它产生的电流能达到 30,000 安培，释放出高达 5 亿焦耳的能量，这相当于一座大规模发电站 1 秒钟发电量的总和。当如此巨大的能量击穿空气时，空气分子就开始急速运动起来。空气中的温度将瞬间飙升至 20,000 摄氏度，这甚至远远超过了太阳表面的温度。这种急剧的温度变化生成压力波，现实中，这种冲击波强大的威力与爆炸无异。

In a lightning strike, there's a high voltage and the flow can be more like 30,000 amps, producing as much as half a billion joules of energy, the total output of a good-sized power station for a second. When this amount of power rips through the air, the result is that the air molecules start to move extremely quickly, the temperature shoots up to as much as 20,000°C, significantly hotter than the surface of the Sun. This sudden change in temperature produces a pressure wave, a shock wave that is, in effect, an explosion.

Early on in the exploration of electricity, Michael Faraday discovered that you can't get an electric charge through to the inside of a metal box. As the electric charge builds up outside such a box, called a Faraday cage, the electrons in the metal that makes up the cage move around to cancel out any charge on the inside. The result is nothing gets through the cage.

Today such an eruption would shut down aviation worldwide, potentially for at least a year. Cold water, particularly from the glacial ice above the volcano, rapidly cooled the blazing hot lava, producing masses of tiny glass-like splinters, which were then thrown up into the air by the explosive force of the eruption. If a lot of this kind of ash gets into a jet engine it can melt again, stick to parts of the engine and solidify, causing problems and, at the extreme, engine shutdown.

Electromagnetic radiation in the form of radio is quite different from ionizing radiation, which is the stuff that comes from radioactive materials. It includes X-rays and even more powerful gamma rays, but also particles like electrons and the nuclei of small atoms. Ionizing radiation is a problem for us because it can penetrate the skin and damage the inner workings of the cells in our bodies. Medium-size doses can increase the risk of cancer, while large doses will produce radiation sickness, and, at extreme levels, death.

On a really clear night, it can see a candle flame 16 kilometres (10 miles) away. It takes only five or six photons of light to trigger a response.

如果你从一个点着电灯的房间里走到明媚的阳光下，你并不会觉得外面有多么亮，也许只比房间里亮 2～3 倍而已。事实上，阳光的强度能比普通灯光强上 100 倍。这就是为什么当你手持摄像机从屋内到屋外时，在机器还没来得及调节好光线之前，你所看到的画面通常将会是白花花的一片曝光过度。在调节光线的能力上，照相机和摄影机远远比不上大脑和眼睛的组合。

If you go from an electrically lit room inside to the outside on a bright sunny day, it doesn't seem hugely brighter, perhaps only a factor of two or three. In reality, outdoor sunlight can be 100 times brighter than typical indoor lighting. This is why, when using a video camera, the view will flare to practical invisibility when you move outside, before the electronics can compensate. The camera isn't as clever as the brain/eye combo at dealing with changes in light levels.

人眼中有将近 700 万个 3 种不同种类的视锥细胞，1.2 亿个比锥细胞更敏感的视杆细胞。视杆细胞负责分辨黑白，视锥细胞负责分辨颜色。在弱光环境中，视锥细胞会停止工作，我们看到的一切都变成灰色的了。在弱光下，用余光看东西比直接盯着它们看来得更清楚。这是因为远离视网膜中央区域的视杆细胞虽然不能分辨颜色，但能感受弱光。人们认为视杆细胞的存在是为了帮助人们在夜间发现向他们逼近的捕食者。

There are about 120 million of these rods, which are significantly more sensitive than the three types of cones, 7 million in all, that deal with colour. When the light levels are low, the cones switch off, leaving our vision as shades of grey. If light is weak, you can see things better if you don't look directly at them. That way the extra rods towards the edges of your vision can come into play. These are thought to be there to help us spot predators, creeping up on us in the dark.

我们看到的一切都是大脑加工后的产物，并非主观事实。这也是为什么人会有幻觉。当眼球开始短暂快速地运动，对物体进行扫视时，你看到的却是稳定连续的图像，这也是种幻象，因为大脑已经对图像进行了编辑。在很长一段时间内，人们用「视觉暂留」来解释为什么人眼能将静止的画面转化为连续的视像。真实的原因是，我们被眼睛蒙蔽了，它们通过一系列模式制造出假象，让你认为这些静止的画面是在做连续运动。

The brain builds an artificial picture of the outside world. What we see really is artificial. This is why optical illusions work. Your eyes are constantly jerking around in tiny, very quick movements called saccades. These are ironed out by the brain, leaving a steady view. For a long time, the reason we saw these pictures as moving was thought to be due to "persistence of vision". Instead, it's the way the eye constructs a fake view using these different modules that allows it to be misled by a series of still images and think it's seeing movement.

由于视神经起始于视网膜后部，这导致人眼产生了一个盲点，物体的影像落在这个地方也不能引起视觉。而大脑训练有素的联想能力则填补了盲点的空白。

Where the optic nerve joins the back of the eye, there's a blind spot, leaving an area of sight where you simply can't see. The brain fills in what's happening in that area by educated guesswork.

** 摩擦力

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
大部分摩擦力都是电磁相互作用引起的。我们知道，物体由原子组成，而原子又是由带正电的原子核和带负电的电子组成，电子在核外空间内做高速运动，在原子核外围形成了一个电荷层。一旦两个物体发生接触，这些电荷就开始相互作用。当你坐下去时，椅子上方带负电的电子与你身体表层的电子之间相互排斥。事实上，你的身体没有和椅子发生接触，你漂浮在那一层电荷斥力互相作用的云状物上。某些原子外层的「电子云」更厚，威力更大，它会把对方原子周围的电子挤开，从而吸引更多正电荷。大多数摩擦力都是由于这样的电磁吸引产生的。

Most friction is electromagnetic. As we've seen, the atoms that make up objects consist of a positively-charged nucleus and negative electrons, forming a cloud of charge around the nucleus. These charges interact whenever two objects are brought together. The negative electrons on the outside of the seat repel the negative electrons on the outside of your body. You don't actually come into contact with the seat, you float just above it on a cloud of repulsion. There's a large electron cloud on one atom it can push the electrons on another atom out of the way, leaving more of a positive charge for it to cling on to. It's this electromagnetic attraction that's responsible for much of friction.
