乡村教堂看上去几乎总是在下沉，这并不是因为教堂在下沉，而是因为教堂庭院在升高。一个乡村教区平均有 250 个居民，也就是说，每个世纪里就有大约 1000 个成人死亡，再加上几千个没能活到成年的可怜虫。把那个数字乘以教堂已经存在的世纪数，葬在这里的人数很可能是 2 万。

Country churches nearly always seem to be sinking into the ground. It isn;t because the church is sinking, it's because the churchyard has risen. A country parish has an average of 250 people in it, which translates into roughly a thousand adult deaths per century, plus a few thousand more poor souls that didn't make it to maturity. Multiply that by the number of centuries that the church has been there, the number of people buried there is probably something in the order of twenty thousand.

很早以来，早在英格兰成为英格兰之前，人们就在这里留下东西。就在我们院落的外面，1985 年有一名从地里走过的农夫拾到了一个稀有的、毫无疑问是罗马人使用的生殖器垂饰。想象有个穿着托加袍的人，站在如今是我的地盘的边缘，全身上下拍了拍，吃惊地发现自己的宝贝东西丢了；之后，那个东西在土里埋了十七八个世纪，经历了无数代的人类活动，经历了撒克逊人、北欧海盗和诺曼人的出现和消失，经历了英语的产生、英格兰民族的诞生、君主政体的延续和发展等等，最后被一个 20 世纪末的农夫拾了起来。

People have been dropping things here for a long time, since long before England was England. Just beyond the edge of our property, in 1985 a farmer crossing a field found a rare, impossible-to-misconstrue Roman phallic pendant. ... the idea of a man in a toga, standing on what is now the edge of my land, patting himself all over and realizing with consternation that he has lost his treasured keepsake, which then lay in the soil for seventeen or eighteen centuries, through endless generations of human activity, through the comings and goings of Saxons, Vikings and Normans, through the rise of the English language, the birth of the English nation, the development of continuous monarchy and all the rest, before finally being picked up by a late-twentieth-century farmer, presumably with a look of consternation of his own.

一个世纪又一个世纪的人默默无闻地从事日常事务，吃饭，睡觉，过性生活，努力自娱自乐。历史在很大程度上就是如此：广大民众做普通的事。然而，我们却认为这些事情是无足轻重的，几乎不值得认真考虑的。

Centuries and centuries of people quietly going about their daily business, eating, sleeping, having sex, endeavouring to be amused. That's really what history mostly is: masses of people doing ordinary things. Yet we treat them as incidental and hardly worthy of serious consideration.

住宅是个极其复杂的博物馆。无论世界上发生了什么，不管人们发现了什么，创造了什么，或激烈争夺了什么，最终都以这种或那种方式落实到你的家里。战争、饥荒、工业革命、启蒙运动等，它们都在你的沙发里和五斗橱里，在你窗帘的皱褶里，在你松软的枕头里，在你家墙上的油漆里，在你家的自来水里。家庭生活的历史，不仅是床、沙发和厨房炉灶的历史，就像我起初无知地以为的那样，而且是坏血病和鸟粪的历史、埃菲尔铁塔的历史、臭虫的历史、盗尸的历史，一切其他已经发生过的事的历史。住宅不是躲避历史的避难所，它们是历史的最终归宿。

Houses are amazingly complex repositories. Whatever happens in the world , whatever is discovered or created or bitterly fought over, eventually ends up, in one way or another, in your house. Wars, famines, the Industrial Revolution, the Enlightenment, they are all there in your sofas and chests of drawers, tucked into the folds of your curtains, in the downy softness of your pillows, in the paint on your walls and the water in your pipes. TSo the history of household life isn't just a history of beds and sofas and kitchen stoves, but of scurvy and guano and the Eiffel Tower and bedbugs and body-snatching and just about everything else that has ever happened. Houses aren't refuges from history. They are where history ends up.

以 1851 年 5 月 1 日在伦敦开幕的「万国工业博览会」展览馆为标志，现代生活的序幕由此拉开，电灯、电话、电报、抽水马桶、麻醉术、室内管道、煤气照明、制冷、汽车、飞机、摩天大楼如雨后春笋般冒出。

在玻璃问世以后的很长时间里，一直是一种奢侈品。除了教堂和少数富裕家庭以外，直到进入 17 世纪以后好长时间，窗玻璃还是个稀罕的物品。即使在最大的房子里，一般情况下也只有最重要的屋子里的窗户才装上玻璃，别的窗户通通使用百叶窗。法国人发明了平板玻璃，这就可以第一次生产出真正大块的玻璃板，使得商店橱窗成为可能。

Glass was really hard to make, which is why for so much of its history it was a luxury item. Other than in churches and a few wealthy homes, window glass was a rarity well into the 1600s. Even in the largest houses generally only the windows in the most important rooms had glass in them. All the others were covered with shutters. the French invented plate glass, this allowed for the first time the creation of really large panes of glass, which made shop windows possible.

窗户税可以追溯到 1696 年，严重打击了人们开窗户的积极性，因此在建筑物上，人们在本来可以开窗户的地方就不开窗户了。玻璃税是从 1746 年开始征收的。它不是根据窗户的数量，而是根据窗户上玻璃的重量来征收，因此在整个乔治时代，玻璃都造得又薄又不结实。窗户税于 1845 年取消，接着，玻璃税也于 1851 年适时废除。而恰好在那个时候，玻璃的价钱也降了一半多，再加上技术进步提高了生产力，使得建造水晶宫成为可能。

The window tax dated from 1696 and was sufficiently punishing that people really did avoid putting windows in buildings where they could. The glass tax, introduced in 1746, was based not on the number of windows but on the weight of the glass within them, so glass was made thin and weak throughout the Georgian period. The glass levy was abolished in 1845, and the abolition of the window tax followed, conveniently and fortuitously, in 1851. Just at the moment when the price of glass was reduced by more than half. This, along with the technological changes that independently boosted production, was the impetus that made the Crystal Palace possible.

1851 年，英国圣公会共有 17621 名神职人员。一位乡村教区长只要照管大约 250 名信徒，便可享受平均 500 英镑的收入，差不多相当于高级公务员的收入。投身神职工作成了贵族和绅士们的年轻儿子所走的捷径之一，另一条是从军。

In 1851, there were 17,621 Anglican clergy, and a country rector, with only 250 or so souls in his care, enjoyed an average income of £500, as much as a senior civil servant. Going into the church became one of the two default activities for the younger sons of peers and gentry. A career in the military was the other.

乡村神职人员的作用是不大明确的。虔诚不一定是个要求，甚至不一定是大家所期望的东西。在英国圣公会里，一个人被授予神职，需要大学学位，但大多数牧师攻读古典文学，不研究神学。结果产生了一批受过良好教育、非常有钱的人。他们有的是空余时间。因此，他们中间的许多人自然而然地开始干一些了不起的事情。

The role of country clergy was a remarkably loose one. Piety was not necessarily a requirement, or even an expectation. Ordination in the Church of England required a university degree, but most ministers read classics and didn't study divinity at all. ... to create a class of welleducated, wealthy people who had immense amounts of time on their hands. In consequence many of them began, quite spontaneously, to do remarkable things.

最不同寻常的神职人员也许要算是托马斯·贝叶斯牧师，他生活在大约 1701 年到 1761 年。他发明了一个数学等式，后来被称为贝叶斯定理。在贝叶斯在世的时候，这个原理没有被实际使用过，你需要计算机才能完成必要的计算，因此，在贝叶斯的年代，那只是一种有趣而又毫无意义的活动。贝叶斯对自己的原理显然不大重视，因此也懒得把它公之于众。1763 年，即贝叶斯去世后两年，一位朋友把它交给了伦敦的皇家学会。皇家学会把它刊登在该学会的《哲学学报》上，并起了个不大显眼的标题：《论用可能性学说来解决问题》。实际上，这个原理在数学史上是个伟大的里程碑。今天，贝叶斯原理用于模拟天气变化、预测股票市场动向、使用放射性碳测定年代、解释宇宙里发生的事件以及其他许多方面，只要在解释概率是个问题的地方，这都要归功于 18 世纪一名英国牧师留下的富有创见的笔记。

Perhaps the most extraordinary clergyman of all was the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who lived from about 1701 to 1761. He devised the mathematical equation that has come to be known as the Bayes theorem. The most remarkable feature of Bayes's theorem is that it had no practical applications without computers to do the necessary calculations, so in his own day it was an interesting but fundamentally pointless exercise. Bayes evidently thought so little of his theorem that he didn't bother to make it public. A friend sent it to the Royal Society in London in 1763, two years after Bayes's death, where it was published in the society's Philosophical Transactions with the modest title of "An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances". In fact, it was a milestone in the history of mathematics. Today Bayes's theorem is used in modelling climate change, predicting the behaviour of stock markets, fixing radiocarbon dates, interpreting cosmological events and much else where the interpretation of probabilities is an issue, and all because of the thoughtful jottings of an eighteenth-century English clergyman.

占世界人口 1.6% 的英国生产了世界上一半的煤和铁，控制着将近 2/3 的海运，从事着 1/3 的贸易。世界上所有的成品棉都产自英国的工厂，而那些工厂里的机器都是英国发明、英国制造的。伦敦银行里的存款，比世界上所有金融中心的存款的总和还要多。这个帝国的面积在巅峰时候将要达到 1150 万平方英里，《上帝保佑女王》将成为世界上 1/4 人口的国歌。

The 1.6 per cent of people who were British produced half the world's coal and iron, controlled nearly two-thirds of its shipping and engaged in one-third of all trade. Virtually all the finished cotton in the world was produced in British mills on machines invented and built in Britain. London's banks had more money on deposit than all the other financial centres of the world combined. ... an empire that would at its peak cover 11.5 million square miles and make "God Save the Queen" the national anthem for a quarter of the world's people.

突然之间，有史以来第一次，在大多数人的生活当中什么都不缺，卡尔·马克思当时住在伦敦，他以一种惊讶的口气说，在英国你可以买到 500 种不同的锤子。伦敦在 12 年里修建了 8 个火车站。这个城市里到处都在修建铁路、桥梁、下水道、泵站、电厂、地铁线。1851 年的人口普查显示，这时候英国的城市人口超过了农村人口，这是全世界第一次出现这种情况。

Suddenly, for the first time in history, there was in most people's lives a lot of everything. Karl Marx, living in London, noted in a tone of wonder, and just a hint of helpless admiration, that it was possible to buy five hundred kinds of hammer in Britain. In twelve years eight railway termini opened in London. ... filling the city with railways, bridges, sewers, pumping stations, power stations, underground lines. The 1851 census also showed that more people in Britain now lived in cities than in the countryside, the first time that this had happened anywhere in the world.

1850 年冬，英国遭受了一场大风暴的袭击，苏格兰奥克尼群岛，风暴肆虐了两天。在一个叫做斯凯尔湾的地方，一个形状不规则的大山丘上的草皮被大风刮得一干二净。风暴终于平息下来，岛民们来到刚刚被改变了样子的海滩。他们吃惊地发现，那个山丘所在的位置现在露出了一个布局紧凑的古代石村的遗址。除了没有屋顶以外，其他方面都奇迹般地保存完好。村子包括 9 栋房子，所有房子里的许多物品还保持原样。这个村子可以追溯到 5000 年以前，比巨石阵和大金字塔还要古老，几乎比地球上的其他人工建筑物都要古老。它被起名为「斯卡拉坡」。

In the winter of 1850, a mighty storm blew into Britain. On the Orkney Islands of Scotland, the storm raged for two days. At a place called the Bay o'Skaill the gale stripped the grassy covering off a large, irregular knoll. When at last the storm cleared and the islanders came upon their newly reconfigured beach, they were astounded to find that where the howie had stood were now revealed the remains of a compact, ancient stone village, roofless but otherwise marvellously intact. Consisting of nine houses, all still holding many of their original contents, the village dates from 5,000 years ago. It is older than Stonehenge and the Great Pyramids, older than all but a handful of built structures on Earth. It is known as Skara Brae.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
斯卡拉坡的复杂结构永远令人感到惊讶。这是新石器时代的人居住的地方，但那些房子居然有能上锁的门，有排水系统，甚至好像还有简单的管道，墙壁里建有槽沟，可以用来排放污水。地板是铺设的。每栋房子里都有嵌入墙内的碗橱、贮藏室、估计是用作床铺的隔间、贮水罐、能使室内保持舒适和干燥的防潮层。

What never fails to astonish at Skara Brae is the sophistication. These were the dwellings of Neolithic people, but the houses had locking doors, a system of drainage and even, it seems, elemental plumbing with slots in the walls to sluice away wastes. The floors were paved. Each house has built-in stone dressers, storage alcoves, boxed enclosures presumed to be beds, water tanks, and damp courses that would have kept the interiors snug and dry.

史前的欧洲在很大程度上是个空荡荡的地方。15,000 年以前，整个不列颠群岛的居民很可能只有 2,000 人。但是到了斯卡拉坡时代，数量已经增加到 20,000 人，但平均每 3,000 英亩土地上仍然只有一个人。我们对这些人一无所知，他们是从哪里来的，他们讲什么语言，他们为什么要在欧洲那个没有树木、那么荒凉的边缘地区定居下来，但从各种证据来看，斯卡拉坡似乎享受了 600 年的舒适、平静的生活。然后，大约在公元前 2,500 年的一天，那里的居民不见了。

Prehistoric Europe was a largely empty place. The number of people in the whole of the British Isles 15,000 years ago may have been as little as 2,000. By the time of Skara Brae, the number had risen to perhaps 20,000, but that is still just one person per 3,000 acres. We don't know anything at all about these people, where they came from, what language they spoke, what led them to settle on such a lonesome outpost on the treeless edge of Europe, but from all the evidence it appears that Skara Brae enjoyed 600 years of uninterrupted comfort and tranquillity. Then one day in about 2500 BC the occupants vanished, quite suddenly, it seems.

人类的过去在传统上分为三个时间不等的时代：旧石器时代，从 250 万年以前到大约 1 万年以前；中石器时代，从 1 万年以前到 6000 年以前，包括从游牧—采集生活方式到大范围出现农业的过渡时期；新石器时代，包括史前生产力极其发达的最后 2000 年，直到青铜器时代。在最初 99% 的历史里，人类没有干多少事，除了繁衍后代，生存下来。

The human past is traditionally divided into three very unequal epochs : the Palaeolithic (or "old stone age"), which ran from 2.5 million years ago to about 10,000 years ago; the Mesolithic ("middle stone age"), covering the period of transition from hunter-gathering lifestyles to the widespread emergence of agriculture, from 10,000 to 6,000 years ago; and the Neolithic ("new stone age") which covers the closing but extremely productive 2,000 years or so of prehistory, up to the Bronze Age. For the first 99 per cent of our history as human beings we didn't do much of anything but procreate and survive.

大约在 12000 年以前，地球开始迅速变暖。然后，在 1000 年左右时间里，不知什么原因又突然重新变得极其寒冷。又过了寒冷的 1000 年以后，世界再次迅速变暖，之后就保持着比较暖和的状态。我们作为高级动物所做的一切，都是在这短暂的黄金气候时期里完成的。

About 12,000 years ago, Earth began to warm quite rapidly, then for reasons unknown it plunged back into frigidity for 1,000 years or so. After 10 further centuries of cold, the world warmed rapidly again and has stayed comparatively warm ever since. Almost everything we have done as advanced beings has been done in this brief spell of climatological glory.

新石器时代革命至今仍是人类发展过程中最大的谜团之一。即使到了现在，科学家能告诉你这一切是在什么时候发生的，发生在哪里，但说不出为什么发生。它在全球发生，在不可能知道远方的别人也在做完全相同的事的人当中发生。农业至少是在 7 个地方独立发明的：在中国、中东、新几内亚、安第斯山脉、亚马孙河流域、墨西哥和西非。同样，城市在 6 个地方出现：中国、埃及、印度、美索不达米亚、中美洲和安第斯山脉。狗是几乎在同一时期、在天各一方的地方，如英格兰、西伯利亚和北美洲，被驯化的。

The Neolithic Revolution remains one of the great mysteries of human development. Even now scientists can tell you where it happened and when, but not why. It happened all over the Earth, among people who could have no idea that others in distant places were doing precisely the same things. Farming was independently invented at least 7 times: in China, the Middle East, New Guinea, the Andes, the Amazon basin, Mexico and west Africa. Cities likewise emerged in 6 places: China, Egypt, India, Mesopotamia, Central America and the Andes. Dogs were domesticated at much the same time in places as far apart as England, Siberia and North America.

在很长的时间里，大家认为，定居和农耕是同时进行的。据认为，人们为了保证自己的食品供应，放弃了游牧生活，开始从事种植业。至少已经有 38 种理论提了出来解释为什么人们开始住在社区里：有的说，因为气候变化，他们不得不那样做；有的说，因为他们希望和过世的家人待在一起；有的说，因为他们极想酿造和饮用啤酒。

For a long time it was thought that settling down - sedentism, as it is known - and farming went hand in hand. People, it was assumed, abandoned nomadism and took up farming in order to guarantee their food supplies. At least 38 theories have been put forward to explain why people took to living in communities: that they were driven to it by climatic change, or by a wish to stay near their dead, or by a powerful desire to brew and drink beer.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
耕种似乎并没有使生活水准有多大改善，一个普通狩猎—采集者吃的食物花样更多，消耗的蛋白质和热量也比定居的人要多。定居的人要依赖品种少得多的食物，因此几乎可以肯定营养不足。史前 3 种主要的驯化作物是稻谷、小麦和玉米，但作为主食都有严重不足的地方。稻谷抑制维生素 A 的作用；小麦里有一种化学物质，会妨碍锌的作用，会导致生长不良；玉米里缺少基本的氨基酸，还含有肌醇六磷酸，会阻碍铁的吸收。

It is not as if farming brought a great improvement in living standards. A typical hunter-gatherer enjoyed a more varied diet and consumed more protein and calories than settled people. Settled people, by contrast, became reliant on a much smaller range of foods, which all but ensured dietary insufficiencies. The three great domesticated crops of prehistory were rice, wheat and maize, but all had significant drawbacks as staples. Rice inhibits the activity of Vitamin A; wheat has a chemical that impedes the action of zinc and can lead to stunted growth; maize is deficient in essential amino acids and contains phytates, which prevent the absorption of iron.

定居生活意味着更差的营养、更多的疾病，经常牙痛，经常牙龈发炎，以及早死。在人们开始一起生活以后，所有的传染病才得以流行。人们在一起生活更容易把疾病从一家传播到另一家。在驯化过程中要跟动物紧密接触，这意味着猪或家禽身上的流感，牛羊身上的天花和麻疹，马和山羊等身上的炭疽病，也可能成为人类疾病的组成部分。

Sedentism meant poorer diets, more illness, lots of toothache and gum disease, and earlier deaths. Virtually all of the infectious diseases have become endemic only since people took to living together. People living together are vastly more likely to spread illness from household to household, and the close exposure to animals through domestication meant that flu (from pigs or fowl), smallpox and measles (from cows and sheep), and anthrax (from horses and goats, among others) could become part of the human condition, too.

从饮食的角度来看，我们依然处在新石器时代。地球上存在 3 万种可以食用的植物。其中 11 种——玉米、稻谷、小麦、马铃薯、木薯、高粱、小米、豆子、大麦、黑麦和燕麦——就占了人类全部食物的 93%，每一种都是我们新石器时代的祖先们最先种植的。

From a dietary point of view, the Neolithic age is still with us. Out of the 30,000 types of edible plant thought to exist on earth, just 11 - corn, rice, wheat, potatoes, cassava, sorghum, millet, beans, barley, rye and oats - account for 93% of all that humans eat, and every one of them was first cultivated by our Neolithic ancestors.

中亚美利加人培育了玉蜀黍，也就是称作玉米的东西。从基因的角度来看，它最近的近亲是一种纤弱的野草，名叫墨西哥类蜀黍。但是，除了在染色体的层面上，二者没有明显的亲缘关系。玉米是从墨西哥类蜀黍设法慢慢培育而成的。但究竟是怎么办到的，现在和过去一样，这仍然是个谜。他们创造了世界上第一种完全转基因的植物，这种植物完全受操纵，连它的生存都依赖于我们。玉米颗粒不会自行从棒子上脱落，因此非得有人去有意剥离并种植，否则就长不出玉米来。假如在过去的几千年里不是有人去不断加以照料，玉米早已灭绝。

Mesoamericans ... the creation of maize, or corn as it is known. Genetically its nearest relative is a wispy grass called teosinte, but beyond the level of chromosomes there is no discernible kinship. Corn was first domesticated ... somehow it was coaxed into being from teosinte, but how it was done remains as much a mystery as it ever did. They created the world's first fully engineered plant, a plant so thoroughly manipulated that it is now wholly dependent on us for its survival. Corn kernels do not spontaneously disengage from their cobs, so unless they are deliberately stripped and planted, no corn will grow. Had people not been tending it continuously for these thousands of years, corn would be extinct.

今天，玉米是不可或缺的，其重要程度远远超出了许多人的认识。玉米淀粉用来生产果味汽水、口香糖、冰激凌、花生酱、糨糊、番茄酱、汽车漆、尸体防腐注射液、火药、杀虫剂、除臭剂、肥皂、油炸土豆条、外科用敷料、指甲油、爽脚粉、色拉调料以及几百种别的用途。

Today corn is far more indispensable than most people realize. Cornstarch is used in the manufacture of fizzy drinks, chewing gum, ice cream, peanut butter, ketchup, automobile paint, embalming fluid, gunpowder, insecticides, deodorants, soap, potato crisps, surgical dressings, nail polish, foot powder, salad dressing and several hundred things more.

当你驱车经过一片玉米地的时候，你会看到它们的每根秆子彼此相同，不仅是表面相似，而且连分子结构也古怪的相同。处于基因完全相同的状态，它们会失去起保护作用的多样性。它们也有相同的弱点，1970 年，一种名叫南方玉米叶枯萎病的疾病开始将全美国的玉米置于死地。人们意识到，实际上，全国所种的玉米，其种子的胞质都具有相同的基因。

When you drive past a field of corn today, every stalk in it is identical to every other, not just extremely similar, but eerily, molecularly identical. As crops are engineered to a state of uniform genetic perfection they will lose their protective variability. They also have matching vulnerabilities. In 1970, the corn world suffered a real fright when a disease called southern corn-leaf blight started killing corn all over America and it was realized that practically the entire national crop was planted from seeds with genetically identical cytoplasm.

Groups all across the ancient world developed a strange, seemingly unquenchable restlessness, and Britain's invaders were clearly part of that. The only written account we have of what happened is that left by the monk known as the Venerable Bede, who was writing 3 centuries after the fact.

他们完全消灭了现存的文化。罗马人在不列颠岛待了 367 年，凯尔特人待了至少 1000 年，然而现在看来他们似乎从来没有待过。罗马人离开高卢和西班牙以后，那里的生活在很大程度上保持原样。居民们还是讲他们自己的那几种拉丁语，那些语言已经在演变成为现代的法语和西班牙语。然而，在不列颠岛，罗马人仅仅留下了 5 个词语，凯尔特人留下来不到 20 个词语，大多数是地理名词，描写不列颠岛特有的地理特征。

They simply obliterated the existing culture. The Romans had been in Britain for 367 years and the Celts for at least 1,000, yet now it was as if they had never been. When the Romans left Gaul and Spain, life went on much as before. The inhabitants continued to speak their own versions of Latin, which were already evolving into modern French and Spanish.

在整个中世纪，直到进入 15 世纪好多年以后，门厅实际上就是住宅，因此习惯上把它的名称用作整个住宅的名称。门厅里最居高临下的（通常也是穿堂风最吹不着的）位置，是一个垒起的平台，叫做「台」，户主和他的家人就在那里吃饭。英国的大学和寄宿学校依然摆着较其他餐桌稍高的贵宾桌。

Through the whole of the medieval period, till well into the 15th century, the hall effectively was the house, so much so that it became the convention to give its name to the entire dwelling.

The head of the household was the "husband", a compound term meaning literally "householder" or "house owner". The practice of land management became known as husbandry. Only much later did "husband" come to signify a marriage partner.

社会主要由自由民、农奴和奴隶组成。奴隶往往是在战争中被俘获的敌人。农奴制是一种使人永远束缚于某个庄园主的奴役方式，往往以一种宗教性质的约定加在人的头上。一旦做出约定，农奴制将永远延续下去，延续到做出约定一方的子孙后代。农奴制的主要后果是，剥夺了租户迁移别处的自由以及与庄园之外的人结婚的自由。但是，农奴仍可以富裕起来，而最下层的自由民虽然在理论上享有自由，但往往穷得无法行使自由。

Society consisted principally of freemen, serfs and slaves. Slaves were often rivals captured in wartime. Serfdom was a form of permanent bondage to a particular lord, and often it was offered as a religious declaration. Serfdom, once declared, extended in perpetuity to all the declaring party's descendants. The principal effect of serfdom was to remove the holder's freedom to move elsewhere or marry outside the estate. But serfs could still become prosperous. By contrast, freemen, known as ceorls, had freedom in principle, but often were too poor to exercise it.

中世纪的庄园往往很分散，中世纪的家庭总是在不停地迁移，一切都设计得便于移动（这就是为什么在法语和意大利语里，「家具」一词分别是 meubles 和 mobili）。许多旧的箱子和衣箱都有半球形盖子，是为了在旅行途中不会积水。衣箱的最大缺点是，为了拿到箱底的东西，你先得把上面的东西拿出去。过了相当长的时间，直到 17 世纪初，才有人想到要在里面装抽屉，于是衣箱就变成了五斗橱。

Medieval estates were often highly fragmented. Medieval households were, in consequence, forever on the move. Everything was designed to be mobile (which is why, not incidentally, the French and Italian words for furniture are meubles and mobili). Portability also explains why many old chests and trunks had domed lids - to throw off water during travel. The great drawback of trunks, of course, is that everything has to be lifted out to get at things at the bottom. It took a remarkably long time, till the 1600s, before it occurred to anyone to put drawers in and thus convert trunks into chests of drawers.

即使在最好的房子里，地面一般也就是在光秃秃的泥土上铺一层草茎。草茎里什么都有，狗和人的唾沫、呕吐物、尿、洒掉的啤酒、残羹剩饭，以及其他说不出口的肮脏东西。地面是个很大的巢穴，深受昆虫和出没无常的老鼠的喜爱，也是个滋生瘟疫的良好基地。即使到了大约莎士比亚时代，木地板和砖地面在条件优越的家庭里开始越来越普遍的时候，地毯依然太珍贵，不会铺在脚底下。地毯只能挂在墙上，或者铺在桌子上。而且，地毯往往保存在箱子里，只有在为了给贵客留下好印象的时候才会拿出来使用。

In even the best houses, floors were generally just bare earth strewn with rushes, harbouring spittle and vomit and urine of dogs and men, beer that hath been cast forth and remnants of fishes and other filth unmentionable. The floors were in effect a very large nest, much appreciated by insects and furtive rodents, and a perfect incubator for plague. Even after wood or tile floors began to grow common in superior homes, at about the time of William Shakespeare, carpets were too precious to be placed underfoot. They were hung on the walls or laid over tables. Often, however, they were kept in chests and brought out only to impress special visitors.

人们坐的是普通的凳子。直到 17 世纪初，椅子是很少见的，而且目的不是为了舒适，而是为了显示权威。即使到了现在，主持会议的人还叫做主席。

Seating was on plain benches. Until the 1600s chairs were rare, and were designed not to be comfortable but to impute authority. Even now, the person in charge of a meeting chairs it.

中世纪的宴会显示，人们吃各种各样异乎寻常的食物，尤其是鸟类，倒不是因为天鹅和别的不寻常的鸟类味道特别鲜美（这类鸟的味道并不鲜美，这是我们现在不吃的原因），而是因为没有更好吃的别的肉类食物。有 1000 年时间，人们几乎不吃牛肉、羊肉和小羊肉。这类动物很宝贵，人们很需要它们的毛、粪便或力气，因此舍不得宰杀。在中世纪的很长时间里，对于大多数人来说，最大的动物蛋白质来源是熏鲱鱼。

Medieval banquets show people eating all kinds of exotic foods that are no longer eaten. Birds especially featured. This wasn't so much because swans and other exotic birds were fantastically delicious (they weren't, that's why we don't eat them now) but rather because other, better meats weren't available. Beef, mutton and lamb were hardly eaten at all for 1,000 years because the animals they came from were needed for their fleeces, manure or muscle power and thus were much too valuable to kill. For much of the medieval period the largest source of animal protein for most people was smoked herring.

人们要花上很长时间才能达到哪怕是最起码的舒适程度。在整个中世纪，每个人在一生中要把相当多的时间完全用来求生存，饥荒是司空见惯的。中世纪的世界是个没有储备的世界。要是收成不好，而平均每 4 年中就有一年农业歉收，马上就会有人吃不饱肚子。人们注定活不长，势必长期过艰苦生活，因此也许不大可能考虑室内装饰的问题。

It really is extraordinary how long it took people to achieve even the most elemental levels of comfort. Throughout the Middle Ages, a good deal of every life was devoted simply to surviving. Famine was common. The medieval world was a world without reserves and when harvests were poor, as they were about one year in four on average, hunger was immediate. When crops failed altogether, starvation inevitably followed. People condemned to short lives and chronic hardship are perhaps somewhat less likely to worry about decor.

我们对 800 年以前英格兰人情况的了解，还不如对古代希腊人和罗马人的了解。几乎没有 1300 年左右以前的家具存留下来；文献上的插图或图片很少，而且自相矛盾。资料如此匮乏，家具史学家甚至不得不从儿歌中进行搜罗。

We know more about how ancient Greeks and Romans sat or reclined than we do about the English of 800 years ago. Almost no furniture survives from before 1300 or so, and illustrations in manuscripts or paintings are scarce and contradictory. Furniture historians are so starved of fact that they must even trawl through nursery rhymes.

盎格鲁—撒克逊人极其喜欢用木材作为建筑材料，不幸的是，木头容易腐烂，因此几乎没有一间存留到现在。据知，在全英国，盎格鲁—撒克逊时代留下来的只有一扇门，威斯敏斯特教堂外侧门厅里的一扇破旧的门。那扇孤零零的门几乎就是那个时代留下来的全部东西。

Anglo-Saxons were extremely attached to timber as a construction material, but unfortunately it is in the nature of wood to rot and almost none of it remains. In the whole of Britain, as far as can be told, just one door survives from the Anglo-Saxon period, a battered oak door in an outer vestibule at Westminster Abbey. And that solitary door is very nearly all that remains (from that period).

要是你有一块知道确切年代的木头，你就可以利用上面的年轮花纹，和同一时代的其他几块木头进行比较，从而确定后者的年代。通过建立一个年轮顺序库，你就能往前追溯很长时间。但是，没有哪两棵树会有完全相同的花纹。一棵树的年轮可能会比另一棵树的狭窄一点，因为它生长在阴处，或在地面上遇到更多竞争，或水的供应较差。为了建立一个可靠的数据库，你需要有大量的树木年轮顺序；为了得出一个精确的读数，你必须做许多巧妙的数据校正工作。

If you have a piece of timber whose age is certain, you can use the patterns of rings on it to match and date other pieces of wood from the same period. By building up a library of ring sequences, you can go back a long way. But no two trees will ever have quite the same pattern. One may have narrower rings than another because it grew in shade or had more competition at ground level or a poorer water supply. In practice you need a huge supply of tree-ring sequences to provide a reliable database and you must make many ingenious statistical adjustments to get an accurate reading.

有一件事没有逃脱中世纪人的注意力：头顶上方的空间几乎都是没有用的，因为一般说来都积满了烟。开放式的火炉有某些明显的优点，它朝各个方向散热，由于有许多人来来往往，加上所有的窗户都没有玻璃，每吹来一阵风便会朝哪个人吹一脸烟，要不就升到天花板，浓浓地挂在那里，直到从屋顶的哪个窟窿里泄出去。这时候需要一样东西，这样东西表面看来似乎并不复杂：一个实用的烟囱。然而，这东西过了很久才出现，倒不是因为没有这个愿望，而是由于技术上的难度。大壁炉里的熊熊烈火产生大量热量，需要牢固的烟道和挡板。最终使这一情况得以改变的，是造出了好的砖头。砖头在长时间耐热方面的性能几乎超过任何岩石，烟囱也使得改用煤作为燃料成为可能。这个改变正是时候，因为英国的木材供应正迅速减少。煤烟是酸性的，有毒，因此必须控制在壁炉或起初所谓的壁炉台里，火苗和烟可以顺着烟道上去。这样，家里就比较干净，但外部世界就比较肮脏了。

One thing that did not escape notice in medieval times was that nearly all the space above head height was unusable because it was so generally filled with smoke. An open hearth had certain clear advantages, it radiated heat in all directions. With many people coming and going and all the windows glassless, every passing gust must have brought somebody a faceful of smoke, or otherwise rose up to the ceiling and hung thickly until it leaked out of a hole in the roof. What was needed was something that would seem, on the face of it, uncomplicatedly straightforward: a practical chimney. This took a long time to happen, however, not because of a lack of will but because of the technical challenges. A roaring fire in a large fireplace generates a lot of heat and needs a sound flue and backstop. What made the difference eventually was the development of good bricks, which can deal with heat better over the long term than almost any rock can. Chimneys also permitted a change in fuel to coal, which was timely because Britain's wood supplies were rapidly dwindling. Because coal smoke was acrid and poisonous, it needed to be contained within a fireplace, or chimneypiece as they were first known, where fumes and smoke could be directed up a flue. This made for a cleaner house but a filthier world outside.
